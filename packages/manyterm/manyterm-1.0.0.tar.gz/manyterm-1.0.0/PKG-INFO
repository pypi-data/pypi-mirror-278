# Manyterm
Spawn multiple terminals to print to.

### Description
This program creates multiple terminals in python. New terminals can only be printed to (no input). `tests/test.py` contains an example of how to use this program. A server is used to print to client windows based on a uuid. When a new window object is made `manyterm.Terminal()` the program check to make sure that the server is running, then assigns itself a uuid, and then the program calls itself from a new terminal using the uuid as an argument. The new program contacts the server with its' uuid and the connection is made.
