    Perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. This mode generates
    configurations by integrating Newtonian equations of motion, allowing the
    system to sample more configurational space and cross small potential energy
    barriers.

    **`1`**

    Perform energy minimization. This mode iteratively moves the atoms down
    the energy gradient to relax the structure until a sufficiently low average
    gradient is obtained. Minimization is useful for preparing a system before
    MD simulations to remove bad contacts and high-energy configurations.

    **`5`**

    Read in a trajectory for analysis using the minimization algorithms.

    Although sander will write energy information in the output files
    (using [`ntpr`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ntpr]),
    it is often desirable to calculate the energies of a set of structures at a
    later point. In particular, one may wish to post-process a set of structures using
    a different energy function than was used to generate the structures.
    An example of this is MM-PBSA analysis, where the explicit water is removed and
    replaced with a continuum model.

    If [`imin`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.imin] is set to
    `5`, sander will read a trajectory file (the `inptraj` argument, specified using
    `-y` on the command line), and will perform the functions described in the `mdin`
    file (e.g., an energy minimization) for each of the structures in this file.
    The final structure from each minimization will be written out to the normal
    `mdcrd` file. If you wish to read in a binary (i.e., NetCDF format) trajectory,
    be sure to set [`ioutfm`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ioutfm]
    to `1`. Note that this will result in the output trajectory having NetCDF format
    as well.

    For example, when [`imin`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.imin]
    is `5` and [`maxcyc`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.maxcyc] is
    `1000`, sander will minimize each structure in the trajectory for 1000 steps and
    write a minimized coordinate set for each frame to the `mdcrd` file.
    If [`maxcyc`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.maxcyc] is `1`, the
    output file can be used to extract the energies of each of the coordinate
    sets in the `inptraj` file.

    Trajectories containing box coordinates can be post-processed. In order to read
    trajectories with box coordinates,
    [`ntb`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ntb] should be greater
    than `0`.

    **`6`**

    Read in a trajectory for analysis using the molecular dynamics driver.

    Like when [`imin`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.imin] is `5`,
    this option reads a trajectory file for analysis (the `inptraj` argument,
    specified using `-y` on the command line). Instead of minimizing the potential
    energy of each coordinate set, it instead initiates dynamics from each frame as
    if it were read as a restart file without initial velocities. That is, this
    option is equivalent to outputting each frame as a restart file and starting the
    dynamics with [`irest`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.irest]
    is `0`. If [`nstlim`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.nstlim] is
    `0`, then this effectively performs a single point energy for each frame.

    **`7`**

    Listen to the selected internet socket and return energies and forces when
    instructed by an external server.

    When this option is set, sander does not perform MD; instead, it listens
    for messages from a server instructing it to compute the potential energy and
    forces of a system. The server IP address and port number are provided as command
    line arguments `-host` and `-port`. The default values are `-host 127.0.0.1` and
    `-port 31415`. The communication pattern follows the protocol implemented in the
    i-PI software. The i-PI program is a molecular dynamics driver used to perform
    classical and centroid path integral molecular dynamics. When i-PI performs
    classical MD, one can instantiate a single sander process to evaluate the
    potential. However, when i-PI is used to perform PIMD, which involves
    calculating potential energies for several “beads” at each time step, multiple
    instances of sander can be launched to simultaneously evaluate the required
    potential energies. The current implementation of the interface is limited to
    simulations in the NVE an NVT ensembles; therefore, one should launch sander with
    a restart file whose unit cell lattice vectors are consistent with the input
    structure supplied to i-PI.

    String that specifies atoms that are not to be shaken
    (assuming that [`ntc`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ntc]>1).
    Any bond that would otherwise be shaken by virtue of the
    [`ntc`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ntc] flag, but which
    involves an atom flagged here, will **not** be shaken.
    Default is an empty string, which matches nothing. A typical use would be to remove
    SHAKE constraints from all or part of a solute, while still shaking rigid water
    models like TIPnP or SPC/E. Another use would be to turn off SHAKE constraints for
    the parts of the system that are being changed with thermodynamic integration, or
    which are the EVB or quantum regions of the system.

    If this option is invoked, then all parts of the potential must be evaluated,
    that is, [`ntf`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ntf] must be `1`.
    The code enforces this by setting
    [`ntf`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.ntf] to `1` when a
    noshakemask string is present in the input.

    If you want the noshakemask to apply to all or part of the water molecules,
    you must also set
    [`jfastw`][schemas.workflow.simulation.amber.inputs.AmberInputsBase.jfastw] to `4`, to turn
    off the special code for water SHAKE. (If you are not shaking waters, you
    presumably also want to issue the "set default FlexibleWater on" command in LEaP;
    see that chapter for more information.)
