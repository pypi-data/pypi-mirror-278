# This code ties in with the concept of a Context. There are a lot of open
# questions about what information is carried on a context and how it is
# represented and transmitted. We believe that the Context need to contain
# information about the full call DAG, but it is currently unclear how this
# information should be encoded. Similarly, it is unclear how this information
# should be transmitted. We believe that gRPC metadata is the correct way of
# transmitting this data but the encoding of the DAG into gRPC metadata is not
# well understood.
#
# From the full call DAG information, it should be possible to obtain various
# information that is needed by the Context, such as the current safety level,
# the actor that is currently being served, etc. Until we have a better idea for
# how we are a) representing these and b) encoding them into metadata headers,
# we are "cherry picking" the necessary DAG information and sticking it on
# individual headers.
#
# This small library is intended as an abstraction layer to provide the ability
# to encode and decode DAG information as grpc headers without having to care
# too much about the current implementation.
