# LabExT - Laboratory Experiment Tool

LabExT, short for Laboratory Experiment Tool, is a software environment for performing laboratory
experiments on silicon-photonic devices and chips. The tool is free, written in Python 3.9 and uses the I/O API VISA
through [pyvisa](https://github.com/pyvisa/pyvisa).

To get started, [install](./installation.md) then [configure](./settings_configuration.md) LabExT. Then you are ready
to [execute the first measurement](./first_simple_measurement.md).
