def write(table: Table, path: str) -> None:
    """
    Writes ``table``'s stream of changes into `DeltaLake <https://delta.io/>_` data
    storage, in a directory located at ``path``.

    If the storage doesn't exist, it will be created, and the schema of the corresponding
    table will be inferred from the output table. Please note that the output table must
    contain two integer columns ``time`` and ``diff`` corresponding to the computation
    minibatch and the nature of the change: ``1`` for row addition and ``-1`` for row
    deletion.

    Args:
        table: Table to be written.
        path: Path to the target output DeltaLake storage directory.

    Returns:
        None

    Example:

    Consider a table ``access_log`` that needs to be output to a DeltaLake storage
    located at the folder ``./logs/access-log``. You can do that as follows:

    >>> pw.io.deltalake.write(access_log, "./logs/access-log")  # doctest: +SKIP

    Please note that if there is no filesystem object under this path, the corresponding
    folder will be created. However, if you run this code twice, it appends the new data
    to the storage created on the first run.
