    the smaller the modification time is, the earlier the file will be passed to the

    Args:
        path: Path to an object or to a folder of objects in Amazon S3 bucket.
        aws_s3_settings: Connection parameters for the S3 account and the bucket.

            it should be given in the format ``<field_name>: <path to be mapped>``,
            where the path to be mapped needs to be a

        debug_data: Static data replacing original one when debug mode is active.

    Returns:
        Table: The table read.

    Example:

    Let's consider an object store, which is hosted in Amazon S3. The store contains
    datasets in the respective bucket and is located in the region eu-west-3. The goal
    is to read the dataset, located under the path ``animals/`` in this bucket.

    Let's suppose that the format of the dataset rows is jsonlines.

    Then, the code may look as follows:

    >>> import os
    >>> import pathway as pw
    >>> class InputSchema(pw.Schema):
    ...   owner: str
    ...   pet: str
    >>> t = pw.io.s3.read(
    ...     "animals/",
    ...     aws_s3_settings=pw.io.s3.AwsS3Settings(
    ...         bucket_name="datasets",
    ...         region="eu-west-3",
    ...         access_key=os.environ["S3_ACCESS_KEY"],
    ...         secret_access_key=os.environ["S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"],
    ...     ),
    ...     format="json",
    ...     schema=InputSchema,
    ... )

    In case you are dealing with a public bucket, the parameters ``access_key`` and
    ``secret_access_key`` can be omitted. In this case, the read part will look as
    follows:

    >>> t = pw.io.s3.read(
    ...     "animals/",
    ...     aws_s3_settings=pw.io.s3.AwsS3Settings(
    ...         bucket_name="datasets",
    ...         region="eu-west-3",
