This library includes a cluster agnostic language to setup a job (one unit of work in a jobspec).
It is a transformational layer, or a simple language that converts steps needed to prepare a job
for a specific clusters scheduler. We are currently prototyping off of the Flux JobSpec, and intent
to derive some variant between that and something more. It is JobSpec... the next generation! üöÄÔ∏è
