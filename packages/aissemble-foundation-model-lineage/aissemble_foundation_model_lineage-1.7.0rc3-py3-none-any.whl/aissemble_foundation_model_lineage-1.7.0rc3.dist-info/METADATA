# aissemble-foundation-model-lineage-python
This module serves as a generic wrapper for model lineage 
types, objects, and functions.  While it is designed to be 
leveraged through the aiSSEMBLE&trade; ecosystem, it is not dependent
on aiSSEMBLE for execution.  It is intentionally designed for 
portability.

### Core Functionality

This module presently provides two main capabilities:

* Generic types to represent Model Lineage metadata
* Convenience methods for updating Model Lineage through various mediums
