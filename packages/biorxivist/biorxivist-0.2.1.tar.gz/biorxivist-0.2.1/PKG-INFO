# BioRxivist

BioRxivist is a platform to explore the possibilities in combinding Large Laguage Models (LLM) with full text pre-publication scientific articles from [BioRxiv](https://biorxiv.org).  Use this tool to obtain datasets from BioRxiv publications build knowledge graphs using [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/).  And facilitate the use of docker run databases and other tools.

# Using BioRxivist to find and load text from papers

The first thing we'll want to do is find a paper of interest.  Well use the object from this package. `BioRxivDriver` will give us access to BioRxiv's search utility. `SearchResuls` will help us manage the results of our search. `BioRxivPaper` will manage how we access text from the papers.

# BioRxivPaper Objects:
BioRxiv Paper objects link us to BioRxiv resources related to individual papers. Once instantiated these papers load a minimal amount of information into memory the URI of the papers homepage and the title.  Other features like the paper's abstract and full text are lazy-loaded properties. They are only accessed once we call them for the first time. After that they are available from memory so we don't have to hit the URL another time.

They are also feed directly into our LangChain pipeline.  In the next section we will make sure of their BioRxivPaper.langchain_html_doc attribute.

    'Microglia integration into human midbrain organoids leads to increased neuronal maturation and functionality'




```python
paper3.abstract
```




    'The human brain is a complex, three-dimensional structure. To better recapitulate brain complexity, recent efforts have focused on the development of human specific midbrain organoids. Human iPSC-derived midbrain organoids consist of differentiated and functional neurons, which contain active synapses, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the absence of microglia, with their ability to remodel neuronal networks and phagocytose apoptotic cells and debris, represents a major disadvantage for the current midbrain organoid systems. Additionally, neuro-inflammation related disease modeling is not possible in the absence of microglia. So far, no studies about the effects of human iPSC-derived microglia on midbrain organoid neural cells have been published. Here we describe an approach to derive microglia from human iPSCs and integrate them into iPSC-derived midbrain organoids. Using single nuclear RNA Sequencing, we provide a detailed characterization of microglia in midbrain organoids as well as the influence of their presence on the other cells of the organoids. Furthermore, we describe the effects that microglia have on cell death and oxidative stress- related gene expression. Finally, we show that microglia in midbrain organoids affect synaptic remodeling and increase neuronal excitability. Altogether, we show a more suitable system to further investigate brain development, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and neuro- inflammation.\n\nMain Points\n\n– Macrophage precursors can be efficiently co-cultured with midbrain organoids, they integrate into the tissue and differentiate into microglia in 3D.\n\n– Organoids containing microglia have a smaller size and show a down-regulation of oxidative stress-related genes.\n\n– Organoids co-cultured with microglia show differences in genes related to synaptic remodeling and action potential, as well as a more spontaneous action potential firing.'

    CSF2-cFLiMo generated from wild-type or gene-deficient mice could be used as a high-throughput screening system to study AM development in vitro and in vivo. Our model is suitable to study the relationship between AM and lung tissue, as well as the roles of specific genes or factors in AM development and function. Furthermore, CSF2-cFLiMo can overcome the limitation in macrophage precursor numbers and be used as a therapeutic approach for PAP disease or in other macrophage-based cell therapies including lung emphysema, lung fibrosis, lung infectious disease and lung cancer (Byrne et al, 2016; Lee et al, 2016; Wilson et al, 2010). Finally, genetically modified and transferred CSF2-cFLiMo might facilitate the controlled expression of specific therapeutic proteins in the lung for disease treatment, and therefore, could represent an attractive alternative to non-specific gene delivery by viral vectors.

    Overall, our studies demonstrate that CSF2-cFLiMo-AM were functionally equivalent to naturally differentiated AM. To determine the number of donor cells required to fully reconstitute the AM compartment of Csf2ra-/- mice, we titrated the number of transferred CSF2-cFLiMo (Fig. 4A). Transfer of a minimum of 5×104 CSF2-cFLiMo to neonatal Csf2ra-/- mice resulted in AM numbers in adult recipients that were comparable to unmanipulated WT mice (around 5×105) (Fig. 4B) and protected mice from PAP (Fig. 4C). We have previously established that around 10% of primary fetal liver monocytes supplied intranasally reach the lung (Li et al, 2020). Thus, CSF2-cFLiMo have expanded around 100-fold 6 weeks after transfer to Csf2ra-/- neonates. Notably, extended time of CSF2-cFLiMo in vitro culture (i.e. 4 months) prior transfer into recipient mice did not negatively affect their differentiation and functional capacity (Fig. 4B, C). Another critical function of tissue-resident macrophages including AM is the removal of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) (Morioka et al, 2019). We compared efferocytosis between CSF2-cFLiMo-AM in Csf2ra-/- mice and AM in WT mice by intratracheal (i.t.) installation of labelled apoptotic thymocytes. CSF2-cFLiMo-AM and AM were equally potent at phagocytosing apoptotic cells from the bronchoalveolar space (Fig. 4D).

## Questions Answering with Sources


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
chain = RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain.from_chain_type(
    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), retriever=retriever
)
```


```python
answer = chain(
    {"question": "What is the role of TGF-beta 1 in monocyte maturation?"},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```


```python
answer
```




    {'answer': 'TGF-beta 1 plays a role in the development of cLP tissue-resident macrophages and is linked to the transition of monocytes to macrophages. Loss of TGFβ-Receptor on macrophages resulted in a minor impairment of macrophage differentiation.\n',
     'sources': 'https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601963v1.full-text, https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.04.447115v2.full-text'}




```python
answer = answer = chain(
    {"question": "How are mice used in TGF-bet 1 research?"},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```


```python
answer
```




    {'answer': 'Mice were infected with Helicobacter hepaticus (Hh) in TGF-bet 1 research.\n',
     'sources': 'https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601963v1.full-text'}




```python
answer = answer = chain(
    {"question": "What factors have been found to impact the activity of alveolar macrophages?"},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```


```python
answer
```




    {'answer': 'Factors that impact the activity of alveolar macrophages include the presence of GM-CSF-induced PPARγ, absence of PPARγ, GM-CSF, or GM-CSFR subunits Csf2ra and Csf2rb, and mutations in CSF2RA and CSF2RB genes. Additionally, the differentiation of M-CSF-derived BMM or GM-CSF-derived BMM can lead to the development of alveolar macrophages.\n',

```python
answer = answer = chain(
    {"question": "What factors have been found to induce anti-inflamatory states in maturing monocytes?"},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```


```python
answer
```




    {'answer': 'The factors that have been found to induce anti-inflammatory states in maturing monocytes are TGFβ and IL10 cytokines.\n',
     'sources': 'https://biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601963v1.full-text'}




```python
answer = answer = chain(
    {"question": "How have monocytes been linked to CXCL4 signaling?"},
    return_only_outputs=True,
)
```


```python
answer
```




    {'answer': 'Monocytes have been linked to CXCL4 signaling through the differentiation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) in the presence of CXCL4. This process was studied to understand the effects of CXCL4 on the trajectory of monocyte differentiation into moDCs and moDC maturation.\n',
