"""API for Named Entity marking.

As a preparation, read `tf.about.annotate` first, since it explains the concepts, and
guides you to set up the configuration for your corpus.

The main task of this module is to find occurrences of annotations
on the basis of criteria.

But this is just the tip of the iceberg, since this module inherits
from a number of other modules that inherit form yet other modules:

*   `tf.browser.ner.show`: generate HTML for annotated buckets of the corpus;
*   `tf.browser.ner.sets`: manage annotation sets;
*   `tf.browser.ner.data`: manage annotation data: loading, adding/deleting
    annotations;
*   `tf.browser.ner.settings`: manage the specifics of a TF corpus and have
    access to its data.

It also uses

*   `tf.browser.ner.match`: to filter individual buckets on the basis of
    criteria.

Hence, `Annotation` is the central class of this tool, whose methods are relevant
for:

*   `tf.browser.ner.ner`: the API for users to manipulate annotations in their
    own programs, especially in a Jupyter notebook.
*   `tf.browser.ner.web`: Flask app that routes URLs to controller functions.

`web` makes use of the following modules that are not needed by `ner`:

*   `tf.browser.ner.serve`: define the controllers of the web app

Again, this is a top of an iceberg, since it inherits from:

*   `tf.browser.ner.request`: manage the data of a request;
*   `tf.browser.ner.fragments`: generate HTML for widgets on the page;

`request` also uses `form` to retrieve form values into typed and structured values.

Both `web` and `ner` make use of the following modules in as far as they are not
already mentioned under `annotate` and its parent classes:

*   `tf.browser.ner.helpers`: a variety of context-free data jugglers;
*   `tf.browser.html`: a generic library to generate HTML using Pythonic
    syntax.
This module contains the top-level methods for applying annotation rules to a corpus.

!!! note "Class hierarchy"
    The classes `Settings`, `Corpus`, `Data`, `Sets`, `Show`, `NER`
    form one hierarchy.
    So an object of class `NER` has access to all methods of these classes.

    The classes `Serve`, `Request`, `Fragments`, `From` form a separate hierarchy.
    It will create an `NER` instance which will be stored in a `Serve` instance.

Here is an overview how the modules hang together.

A `|` denotes inheritance, parent classes above child classes.

A `<-<` arrow denotes dependency by importing code.

```

# Programmatic annotation done in a Jupyter Notebook

If you have a spreadsheet with named entities, and for each entity a list of surface forms,
then this module takes care to read that spreadsheet, translate it to YAML,
and then use the YAML as instructions to add entity annotations to the corpus.

See this
[example notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HuygensING/suriano/blob/main/programs/ner.ipynb).

Here are more details.

## Starting up

Load the relevant Python modules:

``` python
from tf.app import use
```

Load your corpus. There are two ways:

*   Work with a local GitHub clone of the corpus in `~/HuygensING/suriano`:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano:clone", checkout="clone")

*   Or let TF auto-download the latest version and work with that:

        A = use("HuygensING/suriano")

Load the `Ner` module:

``` python
NE = A.makeNer()
```

The tool expects some input data to be present: configuration and spreadsheets with
instructions. They can be found in the `ner` directory.
If you work with a local GitHub clone, that data resides in
`~/github/HuygensING/suriano`
and if you work with an auto-downloaded copy of the data, it is in
`~/text-fabric-data/github/HuygensING/suriano`.

The output data of the tool ends up in the `_temp` directory, which ends up next
to the `ner` directory.

## The entity spreadsheets

Here is an example:

![browser](../../images/Ner/spreadsheet.png)

In our example, the name of the spreadsheet containing this information is
`people.xlsx` and it can be found as `ner/sheets/people.xlsx`

The spreadsheet will be read as follows:

*   the first two rows will be skipped
*   after that, each row is taken to describe exactly one entity
*   the first column has the full and unique name for that entity
*   the second column contains the kind of the entity (you may choose your
    keywords freely for this)
*   the third column contains a number of surface forms for this entity,
    separated by `;`
*   when the surface forms are peeled out, leading and trailing white-space will be
    stripped
*   all other columns will be ignored for the moment; in later versions we may use
    the information in those columns to fill in extra data about the entities;
    but probably that information will not end up in TF features.

During translation from XLSX to YAML the following happens:

*   An identifier is distilled from the name of the entity;
*   Missing kind fields are filled with the default kind.

These steps need some configuration information from the `ner/config.yaml` file.

Translation is done by

``` python
NE.setSheet("people")
```

The resulting YAML ends up next to the
spreadsheet, and it looks like this:

``` yaml
christoffel.sticke:
  kind: PER
  name: Christoffel Sticke
  occSpecs: []
diederik.sticke:
  kind: PER
  name: Diederik Sticke
  occSpecs:
  - Dierck
  - Dirk
dirck.hartog:
  kind: PER
  name: Dirck Hartog
  occSpecs:
  - Dirich Hartocson
  - Hertocson
jan.baptist.roelants:
  kind: PER
  name: Jan-Baptist Roelants
  occSpecs:
  - Roelans
  - Rolans
```

## Inventory

A first step is to find out how many occurrences we find in the corpus for these
surface forms:

``` python
NE.reportHits()
```

and the output looks like this

```
...

cornelis.adriaensz       PER   Pach                     7 x Cornelis Adriaensz. Pack
david.marlot             PER   Morlot                   1 x David de Marlot
erick.dimmer             PER   Dimer                   11 x Erick Dimmer
erycius.puteanus         PER   Potiano                  2 x Erycius Puteanus
francesco.giustiniani    PER   Giustiniano             11 x Francesco Giustiniani
francois.doubleth        PER   Doublet                  2 x FranÃ§ois Doubleth

...

Total 150
```

Entities that are in the spreadsheet, but not in the corpus are skipped.

## Inspection

We now revert to lower-level methods from the `tf.browser.ner.ner` class to
inspect some of the results.

``` python
results = NE.filterContent(bFind="pach", bFindC=False, anyEnt=True, showStats=None)
```

Here we filtered the chunks (paragraphs) to those that contain the string `pach`,
in a case-insensitive way, and that contain at least one entity.

There 6 of them, and we can show them:

``` python
NE.showContent(results)
```

![browser](../../images/Ner/pach.png)

The resulting entities are in `_temp/power/entities.tsv` and look like this:

```
erick.dimmer	PER	160196
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	142613
gaspar.iii.coligny	PER	7877
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	210499
john.vere	PER	94659
antonio.lando	PER	267755
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	107069
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	9162
michiel.pagani	PER	94366
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	179208
isabella.clara.eugenia	PER	258933
hans.meinhard	PER	75039

...
```

Each line corresponds to a marked entity occurrence.
Lines consist of tab separated fields:

*   entity identifier
*   entity kind
*   remaining fields: slots, i.e. the textual positions occupied by the occurrence.
    Some entity occurrences consist of multiple words / tokens, hence have multiple
    slots.

        Basic methods to handle the various aspects of entity annotation.
        These methods can be used by code that runs in the TF browser

        This class handles entity sets, it does not contain code to generate HTML.
        But it has a parent class, `Show`, that can generate HTML.

        This class works with a fixed annotation set.

        and switch between them.

        We consider the corpus as a list of buckets (typically level-3 sectional
        units; in TEI-derived corpora called `chunk`, being generalizations of
        `p` (paragraph) elements). What type exactly the buckets are is configured
        in the `ner/config.yaml` file.

        of buckets, or a subset of buckets, namely those contained in a
        particular node, see parameters `node`, and `buckets`.

        **Bucket filtering**

        The parameters `bFind`, `bFindC`, `bFindRe`  specify a regular expression
        search on the texts of the buckets.

        The positions of the found occurrences is included in the result.

        The parameter `anyEnt` is a filter on the presence or absence of entities in
        buckets in general.

        **Entity filtering**

        The parameter `eVals` holds the values of a specific entity to look for.

        **Occurrence filtering**

        The parameter `qTokens` is a sequence of tokens to look for.
        The occurrences that are found, can be filtered further by `valSelect`
        and `freeState`.

        In entity filtering and occurrence filtering, the matching occurrences
        are included in the result.

        Parameters
        ----------
        buckets: set of integer, optional None
            The set of buckets to filter, instead of the whole corpus.
            Works also if the parameter `node` is specified, which also restricts
            the buckets to filter. If both are specified, their effect will be
            combined.
        node: integer, optional None
            Gets the context of the node, typically the intermediate-level section
            in which the node occurs. Then restricts the filtering to the buckets
            contained in the context, instead of the whole corpus.
        bFind: string, optional None
            A search pattern that filters the buckets, before applying the search
            for a token sequence.
        bFindC: string, optional None
            Whether the search is case sensitive or not.
        bFindRe: object, optional None
            A compiled regular expression.
            This function searches on `bFindRe`, but if it is None, it compiles
            `bFind` as regular expression and searches on that. If `bFind` itself
            is not None, of course.
        anyEnt: boolean, optional None
            If True, it wants all buckets that contain at least one already
            marked entity; if False, it wants all buckets that do not contain any
            already marked entity.
        eVals: tuple, optional None
            A sequence of values corresponding with the entity features `eid`
            and `kind`. If given, the function wants buckets that contain at least
            an entity with those properties.
        qTokens: tuple, optional None
            A sequence of tokens whose occurrences in the corpus will be looked up.
        valSelect: dict, optional None
            If present, the keys are the entity features (`eid` and `kind`),
            and the values are iterables of values that are allowed.

            The feature values to filter on.
            The results of searching for `eVals` or `qTokens` are filtered further.
            If a result is also an instance of an already marked entity,
            the properties of that entity will be compared feature by feature with
            the allowed values that `valSelect` specifies for that feature.
        freeState: boolean, optional None
            If True, found occurrences may not intersect with already marked up
            features.
            If False, found occurrences must intersect with already marked up features.
        showStats: boolean, optional None
            Whether to show statistics of the find.
            If None, it only shows gross totals, if False, it shows nothing,
            if True, it shows totals by feature.

        Returns
        -------
        list of tuples
            For each bucket that passes the filter, a tuple with the following
            members is added to the list:

            *   the TF node of the bucket;
            *   tokens: the tokens of the bucket, each token is a tuple consisting
                of the TF slot of the token and its string value;
            *   matches: the match positions of the found occurrences or entity;
            *   positions: the token positions of where the text of the bucket
                starts matching the `bFindRe`;

            If `browse` is True, also some stats are passed next to the list
            of results.
