# telemetrx-0.1.5

telemetrx is a Python library which facilitates the sending of App telemetry data to the TelemetrX platform, leveraging the TelemetrX API. 

## Features

The library features the function send_telemetrx() which helps app owners to send telemetry data to the TelemetrX platform with a single line of code. 

## Installation

Install telemetrx with pip:

```bash
pip install telemetrx
```

## Quick Start

Before you start, there are few environment variables that will need to be set:

- BASE_URL_ENV = Telemetrx API URL for ENV

    Where ENV is either DEV, PROD or STAGE depending on which environment your app is sending data to. 
    If you are unsure what value to set in this environment variable, please contact visimard@cisco.com or vivekksi@cisco.com or anpapath@cisco.com. 

- TELEMETRX_API_KEY = <Your app's API key for TelemetrX>

    This is the app token you have received when registering your app with TelemetrX. If you do not know your app key or have lost/forgotten it, please contact visimard@cisco.com or vivekksi@cisco.com or anpapath@cisco.com

After you make sure that the environment variables above are set, here is an example of how to use the telemetrx library:

```python
from telemetrx import send_telemetrx

telemetry_data = {"attribute1": "value",
                  "attribute2": "value"}

send_telemetrx(telemetry_data=telemetry_data, 
               user="anpapath",
               app_name= "My app",
               telemetrx_env= "prod",
               technology_stripe= "Enterprise"
               )
```
