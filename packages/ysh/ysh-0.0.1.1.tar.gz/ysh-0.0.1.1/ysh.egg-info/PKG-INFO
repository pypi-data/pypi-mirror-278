# ysh

ysh is a basic shell implementation written in Python that allows users to execute Unix commands. It also features command history functionality, enabling users to navigate through previously executed commands using the up/down arrow keys.

## Features

- Execute Unix commands directly within the shell.
- Command history: Navigate through previously executed commands using up/down arrow keys.
- Command history is persistent: All executed commands are saved in `~/.ysh_history`.
- [Future] Tab completion functionality.

## Installation

    pip install ysh    

## Usage
