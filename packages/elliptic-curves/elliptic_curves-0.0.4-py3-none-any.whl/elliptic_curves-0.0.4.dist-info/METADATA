This package implements elliptic curves over various fields.

## Contents

The `elliptic.curves` module implements elliptic curves. An interface for fields is specified in the `elliptic.abc` module. This package provides several field implementations:
- `elliptic.mod`: modular fields
- `elliptic.fin`: Galois fields
- `elliptic.inf`: infinite fields

The implementation is not concerned with cryptographic safety. It cares for results being correct, but not secure.
