This library implements a flow-based generative model and bijectors which are implemented as FLAX modules. Conditional flows are supported.

## License

The source code is released under the MIT license.

## Installation

```sh
pip install zenflow
```

## Documentation

There is currently no online documentation, but the library has useful docstrings. Please use the docstrings and look into the usage examples in the `examples` folder.

## History

This project was originally forked from [PZFlow](https://github.com/jfcrenshaw/pzflow) by [John Franklin Crenshaw](jfcrenshaw@gmail.com), but largely rewritten. PZFlow itself draws from other repositories, which are listed in the PZFlow documentation. I needed a code base which is simple to understand and stripped down to the essentials for my use case. Differences between PZFlow and zenflow:

* zenflow uses generic JAX arrays for data input and output, while PZFlow enforces the use of Pandas.
* zenflow implements all trainable objects as FLAX modules, while PZFlow uses JAX primitives. Like FLAX, zenflow follows a clean functional design.
* PZflow supports training on data points with uncertainties, zenflow has no support for that.
* PZflow supports computing marginalized posterior densities, zenflow has no support for that.
* PZflow supports periodic data, which is currently not supported by zenflow (I plan to reintroduce this later).
* PZflow supports more bijectors than zenflow.
