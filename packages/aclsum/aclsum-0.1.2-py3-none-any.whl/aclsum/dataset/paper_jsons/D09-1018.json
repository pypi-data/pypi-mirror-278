Specifically, the discourse scheme we use is from Somasundaran et al. (2008) , which was developed to support a global, interdependent polarity interpretation. To achieve discourse-based global inference, we explore two different frameworks. The first is a supervised framework that learns interdependent opinion interpretations from training data. The second is an unsupervised optimization framework which uses constraints to express the ideas of coherent opinion interpretation embodied in the scheme. For the supervised framework, we use Iterative Collective Classification (ICA), which facilitates machine learning using relational information. The unsupervised optimization is implemented as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Via our implementations, we aim to empirically test if discourse-based approaches to opinion analysis are useful.",

We also find that there is a difference in the way ICA and ILP achieve improvements, and a simple hybrid approach, which incorporates the strengths of both, is able to achieve significant overall improvements over both. Our analyses show that even when our discourse-based methods bootstrap from noisy classifications, they can achieve good improvements.",

The first is ICA, where discourse relations and the neighborhood information brought in by these relations are incorporated as features into the learner.

The local classifier is trained to predict the DA labels using only the local features. We use Local, described in Section 4.1, for this purpose. The relational classifier is trained using the local features, and an additional set of features commonly referred to as relational features. The value of a relational feature, for a given DA, depends on the polarity of the discourse neighbors of that DA. Thus, the relational features incorporate discourse and neighbor information; that is, they incorporate the information about the frame and target relations in conjunction with the polarity of the discourse neighbors. Intuitively, our motivation for this approach can be explained using Example 1. Here, in interpreting the ambiguous opinion a bit different as being positive, we use the knowledge that it participates in a reinforcing discourse, and that all its neighbors (e.g., ergonomic, durable) are positive opinions regarding the same thing. On the other hand, if it had been a non-reinforcing discourse, then the polarity of a bit different, when viewed with respect to the other opinions, could have been interpreted as negative.",

Features are generated for all combinations of a, t, t , f and f for each row.

In the bootstrapping phase, the polarity of each instance is initialized to the most likely value given only the local classifier and its features. In the iterative phase, we create a random ordering of all the instances and, in turn, apply the relational classifier to each instance where the relational features, for a given instance, are computed using the most recent polarity assignments of its neighbors. We repeat this until some stopping criterion is met. For our experiments, we use a fixed number of 30 iterations, which has been found to be sufficient in most data sets for ICA to converge to a solution.",

On the other hand, a pair of individual polarity assignments most consistent with a discourse scenario where a speaker reinforces his stance via opinions towards alternative options, is one with opinions having mutually opposite polarity. For instance, in the utterance \"Shapes should be curved, nothing square-like\", the speaker reinforces his procurved stance via his opinions about the alternative shapes: curved and square-like.

Table 5 reports the performance of ILP and Local for the precision, recall and f-measure metrics (averaged over 7 test folds), measured separately for each of the opinion categories. The most prominent improvement by ILP is observed for the recall of the polar categories under the Connected condition: 40 percentage points for the positive class, and 29 percentage points for the negative class. The gain in recall is not accompanied by a significant loss in precision. This results in an improvement in f-measure for the polar categories (24 points for positive and 16 points for negative). Also note that, by virtue of the constraint in Equation 7, ILP does not classify any connected instance as neutral; thus the precision is NaN, recall is 0 and the f-meaure is NaN. This is indicated as * in the Table . The improvement of ILP for the All condition, for the polar classes, follows a similar trend for recall (18 to 21 point improvement) and f-measure (9 to 13 point improvement). In addition to this, the ILP has an overall improvement in precision over Local. This may seem counterintuitive, as in Table 5 , ILP's precision for connected nodes is similar to, or lower than, that of Local. This is explained by the fact that, while going from connected to overall conditions, Local's polar predictions increase by threefold (565 to 1482), but its correct polar predictions increase by only twofold (430 to 801). Thus, the ratio of change in the total polar predictions to the correct polar predictions is 3 : 2. On the other hand, while polar predictions by ILP increase by only twofold (1067 to 1984), its correct polar predictions increase by 1.5 times (804 to 1175). Here, the ratio of change in the total polar predictions to the correct polar predictions is 4 : 3, a smaller ratio.",

Methods starting with noisy starting points are in danger of propagating the errors and hence worsening the performance. Interestingly, in spite of starting with so many bad classifications, ILP is able to achieve a large performance improvement. We discovered that, given a set of connected instances, even when Local has only one correct guess, ILP is able to use this to rectify the related instances. We illustrate this situation in Figure 2 as neutral (*), and DA-5 (containing a bit different from all the other remote controls) as negative (-). DA-2 and DA-5 exemplify the fact that polarity classification is a complex and difficult problem: being bouncy is a positive evaluation in this particular discourse context, and may not be so elsewhere. Thus, naturally, lexicons and unigram-based learning would fail to capture this positive evaluation. Similarly, \"being different\" could be deemed negative in other discourse contexts. However, ILP is able to arrive at the correct predictions for all the instances. As the DA-4 is connected to both DA-2 and DA-5 via a discourse relation that enforces an equal-polarity constraint (same+reinforcing relation of row 1, Table 2 ), both of the misclassifications are rectified. Presumably, the incorrect predictions made by Local are low confidence estimates, while the predictions of the correct cases have high confidence, which makes it possible for ILP to make the corrections.",
