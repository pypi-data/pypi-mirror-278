In this paper we demonstrate that a CCG parser can be adapted to two new domains, biomedical text and questions for a QA system, by using manually-annotated training data at the POS and lexical category levels only. This approach achieves parser accuracy comparable to that on newspaper data without the need for annotated parse trees in the new domain. We find that retraining at the lexical category level yields a larger performance increase for questions than for biomedical text and analyze the two datasets to investigate why different domains might behave differently for parser adaptation.",

A related question is how to improve the performance of these parsers on constructions that are rare in the Penn Treebank, such as questions.

A key property of CCG is that it is lexicalized, meaning that each word in a sentence is associated with an elementary syntactic structure. In the case of CCG this is a lexical category expressing subcategorization information. We exploit this property of CCG by performing manual annotation in the new domain, but only up to this level of representation, where the annotation can be carried out relatively quickly. Since CCG lexical categories are so expressive, many of the syntactic characteristics of a domain are captured at this level.",

We use the term \"domain\" somewhat loosely here, since questions are best described as a particular set of syntactic constructions, rather than a set of documents about a particular topic. However, we consider question data to be interesting in the context of domain adaptation for the following reasons: 1) there are few examples in the Penn Treebank (PTB) and so PTB parsers typically perform poorly on them; 2) questions form a fairly homogeneous set with respect to the syntactic constructions employed, and it is an interesting question how easy it is to adapt a parser to such data; and 3) QA is becoming an important example of NLP technology, and question parsing is an important task for QA systems.",

The results also show, however, that the two domains have different profiles with regard to the levels of representation used by the parser. We find that simply retraining the POS tagger used by the parser leads to a large improvement in performance for the biomedical domain, and that retraining the CCG supertagger on the annotated biomedical data improves the performance further. For the question data, retraining just the POS tagger also improves parser performance, but retraining the supertagger has a much greater effect. We perform some analysis of the two datasets in order to explain the different behaviours with regard to porting the CCG parser.",

Supertagging was originally developed for Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), but has been particularly successful for wide-coverage CCG parsing (Clark and Curran, 2007b) . Rather than assign a single category to each word, the supertagger operates as a multitagger, sometimes assigning more than one category if the context is not sufficiently discriminating to suggest a single tag (Curran et al., 2006) . Since the taggers have linear time complexity, the first two stages can be performed extremely quickly.",

Figure 1 gives an example sentence from each target domain, with the CCG lexical category assigned to each word shown below the word, and the POS tag to the right. Note that the categories contain a significant amount of grammatical information, in particular subcategorization information. The verb acts in the biomedical sentence, for example, looks for a prepositional phrase (PP, as a linkage protein) to its right and a noun phrase (NP, Talin) to its left, with the resulting category a declarative sentence (S[dcl] ). Bangalore and Joshi (1999) refer to supertagging as almost parsing, because once the correct lexical categories have been assigned, the parser is left with much less work to do. The CCG supertagger is not able to assign a single category to each word with extremely high accuracy -hence the need for it to operate as a multi-tagger -but even in multi-tagger mode it dramatically reduces the ambiguity passed through to the parser (Clark and Curran, 2007b) . The parser has been evaluated on DepBank (King et al., 2003) , using the GR scheme of Briscoe et al. (2006) , and it scores 82.4% labelled precision and 81.2% labelled recall overall (Clark and Curran, 2007a) . Section 4.4 describes how the CCG dependencies can be mapped into the Stanford GR scheme (de Marneffe et al., 2006) and gives the results of evaluating the parser on biomedical and question GR resources.",

This capability is crucial for question parsing, and also useful in the biomedical field for extraction of relationships between biological entities.

If the POS tagger assigns incorrect tags, it is unlikely that the supertagger will be able to recover and produce the correct lexical categories, since it relies heavily on POS tags as features. Without the correct categories, the parser in turn will be unable to find a correct parse.",

The parser then assigns the Vietnam War end the structure of a noun phrase, and chooses an unusual subcategorization frame for did in which it takes three arguments: What, year, and the Vietnam War end.",

Instead it is tagged as S [wq]/S [q], the category for a sentential adverb (i.e. the manner reading of how), which prevents a correct parse.

CCG lexical categories require more expertise, but our experience shows that an out-of-domain supertagger can again provide a starting point for correction, and since the annotation is flat rather than hierarchical, we hypothesize that it is not as difficult or timeconsuming as annotation of full derivations.",

Lease and Charniak (2005) obtained an improvement in the accuracy of the Charniak (2000) parser, as well as POS tagging accuracy, when applied to the biomedical domain, by training a new POS tagger model with a combination of newspaper and biomedical data. The parser improvement was due solely to the new POS tagger, without retraining the parser model. Since the Charniak parser does not use a lexicalized grammar with an intermediate level of representation, any further improvements would have to come from the parser model itself. Clark et al. (2004) obtained an improvement in CCG supertagging accuracy for What-questions by training a new supertagger model with a combination of newspaper and question data annotated with CCG lexical categories. Because a question resource annotated with GRs was not available, they did not perform a parser evaluation, and the effects of the POS tagging level were not compared to the lexical category level. In this paper, we extend the pilot experiments performed by Clark et al. (2004) in four ways. First, we use a larger corpus of TREC questions covering additional question types, thus extending the experiments to the question domain more broadly, as well as to the biomedical domain. Second, we create a gold standard GR resource enabling a full parser evaluation on question data. Third, we show that the POS level is important for adaptation, reinforcing the work of Lease and Charniak (2005) . A key finding of the present paper is that the combination of retraining at the POS tag and lexical category levels provides additional improvements beyond those gained by retraining at a single level. Finally, we provide analysis comparing the adaptation methodology for question and biomedical data.",

The main difference between newspaper and question data, on the other hand, is syntactic. Retraining the POS tagger for questions therefore had less effect; even with the correct POS tags the supertagger was unable to assign the correct lexical categories.

This tagger error arises from the fact that the word What occurs only once in WSJ 02-21 with a WDT tag. The second most common error was on bare verbs (VB), because the newspaper model gives a low probability of bare verbs occurring in sentence-final position, or not directly following an auxiliary. For the biomedical data, the most frequent errors by far were confusions of noun (NN) and adjective (JJ). This is most likely due to the prevalence of long noun phrases in the biomedical data, such as major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Although the words preceding the head noun are recognized as nominal modifiers, the classification into noun and adjective is difficult, especially when the word is previously unseen.
