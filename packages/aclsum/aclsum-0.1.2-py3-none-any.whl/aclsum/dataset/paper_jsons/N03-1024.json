Although this is adequate in the context of some applications, it is clearly too weak from a generative perspective. Assume, for example, that we know that text pairs (stock market rose, stock market gained) and (stock market rose, stock prices rose) have the same meaning. If we memorized only these two pairs, it would be impossible to infer that, in fact, consistent with our intuition, any of the following sets of phrases are also semantically equivalent: {stock market rose, stock market gained, stock prices rose, stock prices gained } and {stock market, stock prices } in the context of rose or gained; {market rose }, {market gained }, {prices rose } and {prices gained } in the context of stock; and so on.",

We propose a new, finite-statebased representation of paraphrases that enables one to encode compactly large numbers of paraphrases. We also propose algorithms that automatically derive such representations from inputs that are now routinely released in conjunction with large scale machine translation evaluations (DARPA, 2002) : multiple English translations of many foreign language texts. For instance, when given as input the 11 semantically equivalent English translations in Figure 1 , our algorithm automatically induces the FSA in Figure 2 , which represents compactly 49 distinct renderings of the same semantic meaning. Our FSAs capture both lexical paraphrases, such as {fighting, bat-tle}, {died, were killed} and structural paraphrases such as {last week's fighting, the battle of last week}. The contexts in which these are correct paraphrases are also conveniently captured in the representation.",

(2001) and Barzilay and Lee (2002) both applied the technique of multi-sequence alignment (MSA) to align parallel corpora and produced similar FSAs. For their purposes, they mainly need to ensure the correctness of consensus among different translations, so that different constituent orderings in input sentences do not pose a serious prob- lem. In contrast, we want to ensure the correctness of all paths represented by the FSAs, and direct application of MSA in the presence of different constituent orderings can be problematic. For example, when given as input the same sentences in Figure 1 , one instantiation of the MSA algorithm produces the FSA in Figure 3 , which contains many \"bad\" paths such as the battle of last week's fighting took at least 12 people lost their people died in the fighting last week's fighting (See Section 4.2.2 for a more quantitative analysis.). It's still possible to use MSA if, for example, the input is pre-clustered to have the same constituent ordering (Barzilay and Lee (2003) ). But we chose to approach this problem from another direction. As a result, we propose a new syntax-based algorithm to produce FSAs.",

Since we adopted a very strict matching criterion in top-down merging, a small difference in the syntactic structure of two trees prevents some legitimate mergings from taking place. This behavior is also exacerbated by errors in syntactic parsing. Hence, for instance, three edges labeled detroit at the leftmost of the top FSA in Figure 6 were kept apart. To compensate for this effect, our algorithm implements an additional step, which we call squeezing. If two different edges that go into (or out of) the same node in an FSA are labeled with the same word, the nodes on the other end of the edges are merged. We apply this operation exhaustively over the FSAs produced by the top-down merging procedure. Figure 6 illustrates the effect of this operation: the FSA at the top of this figure is compressed into the more compact FSA shown at the bottom of it. Note that in addition to reducing the redundant edges, this also gives us paraphrases not available in the FSA before squeezing (e.g. {reduced to rubble, blasted to ground}). Therefore, the squeezing operation, which implements a limited form of lexically driven alignment similar to that exploited by MSA algorithms, leads to FSAs that have a larger number of paths and paraphrases.",

Ideally, if the FSAs we build accept all and only the correct renderings of a given meaning, we can just give a test sentence to the reference FSA and see if it is accepted by it.
