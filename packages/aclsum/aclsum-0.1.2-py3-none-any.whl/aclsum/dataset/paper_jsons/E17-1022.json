The arrival of such treebanks, expanded and improved on a regular basis, provides a new milestone for crosslingual dependency parsing research (McDonald et al., 2013) . Furthermore, given that UD rests on a series of simple principles like the primacy of lexical heads, cf. Johannsen et al. (2015) for more details, we expect that such a formalism lends itself more naturally to a simple and linguistically sound rulebased approach to cross-lingual parsing.

We evaluate our system on 32 languages 1 in three setups, depending on the reliability of available POS tags, and compare to a multi-source delexi-calized transfer system. In addition, we evaluate the systems' sensitivity to domain change for a subset of UD languages for which domain information was retrievable. The results expose a solid and competitive system for all UD languages. Our unsupervised parser compares favorably to delexicalized parsing, while being more robust to domain change.",

We have selected the set of head rules to maximize precision on the development set, and they do not provide full coverage. The system makes any word not covered by the rules (e.g., a word with a POS such as X or SYM) either dependent of their left or right neighbor, according to the estimated runtime parameter. We report the best head direction and its score for each language in Table 5 . This baseline finds the head of each token based on its closest possible head, or on its immediate left or right neighbor if there is no head rule for the POS at hand, which means that this system does not necessarily yield well-formed tress. Each token receives a head, and while the structures are single-rooted, they are not necessarily connected. Note that we do not include results for the DMV model by Klein and Manning (2004) , as it has been outperformed by a system similar to ours (S\u00f8gaard, 2012b) .

However, with an average POS accuracy by TnT of 94.1%, the error propagation is 0.37, i.e, each POS error causes 0.37 additional dependency errors. In contrast, for MSD this error propagation is 0.46, thus higher. 5 For the extreme POS scenario, content vs. function POS (CF), the drop in performance for UDP is very large, but this might be too crude an evaluation setup. Nevertheless, UDP, the simple unsupervised system with PageRank, outperforms the adjacency baselines (BL) by \u223c4% on average on the two type-based naive POS tag scenario.

Given how much of the overall dependency structure can be explained by this fairly system, we propose UDP as an additional UD parsing baseline. The parser, the in-house annotated test sets, and the domain data splits are made freely available. 6UD is a running project, and the guidelines are bound to evolve overtime. Indeed, the UD 2.0 guidelines have been recently released. UDP can be augmented with edge labeling for some deterministic labels like case or det. Some further constrains can be incorporated in UDP. Moreover, the parser makes no special treatment of multiword expression that would require a lexicon, coordinations or proper names. All these three kinds of structures have a flat tree where all words depend on the leftmost one. While coordination attachment is a classical problem in parsing and out of the scope of our work, a proper name sequence can be straightforwardly identified from the partof-speech tags, and it falls thus in the area of structures predictable using simple heuristics. Moreover, our use of PageRank could be expanded to directly score the potential dependency edges instead of words, e.g., by means of edge reification.",
