Chinese words are classified into eight morphological types by two proposed classifiers, CRF classifier and SVM classifier. Experiments show that the injection of morphological information improves the performance of the word polarity detection. To utilize syntactic structures, we annotate structural trios to represent relations between sentence segments. Experiments show that considering structural trios is useful for sentence opinion analysis. The best f-score achieves 0.77 for opinion word extraction, 0.62 for opinion word polarity detection, 0.80 for opinion sentence extraction, and 0.54 for opinion sentence polarity detection.",

Carenini's team proposed a graphical user interface for evaluative texts (2006) , in which color blocks were used to present the evaluations for components of products. Fair News Reader, a Japanese news Web system, incorporates sentiment information insensibly in an interesting way (Kawai et al., 2007) .

Both of them outperform baseline's f-score 0.5455, i.e., the bag-of-characters approach (Ku et al., 2007) . Experiments show that adopting morphological types annotated by two classifiers for polarity prediction has little difference. In other words, CRF and SVM classifiers have an 8% f-score difference in their best performance of classification, while the performance gap in word polarity prediction using morphological types provided by these two classifiers is around 1.3% only (0.5806 vs. 0.5938). The reason may be that we define scoring functions of each morphological type in a straightforward way. If they are not the best scoring functions, the benefit of considering the morphological type information could be restricted. Nevertheless, experimental results show that morphological type information is useful for word polarity detection (with p-value less than 0.05).",

We further analyze the improvement of polarity prediction for each morphological type.

Experiments show that CRF classifier achieves the best accuracy 0.70 in type classification, which is 8% better than SVM classifier. We further show that word morphological structures benefit the opinion word extraction significantly. With the help of the sentiment dictionary NTUSD, the f-score of opinion word extraction achieves 0.77 and the f-score of the word polarity detection achieves 0.62 when the word morphological types are provided by the SVM classifier. They are comparably better than bag-of-character approach and the dictionary based approach.",
