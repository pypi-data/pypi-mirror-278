To answer this need, we have developed a representation framework comprised of an abstract model for a variety of different annotation types (e.g., morpho-syntactic tagging, syntactic annotation, co-reference annotation, etc.), which can be instantiated in different ways depending on the annotator s approach and goals. In this paper we provide an overview of our representation framework and demonstrate its applicability to syntactic annotation.

Some grammatical roles (subject, object, etc.) are implicit in the structure of the encoding: for instance, the nesting of the NP the front room implies that the NP is the object of the prepositional phrase, whereas the position of the NP him following and at the same level as the VP node implies that this NP is the grammatical object. Additional processing (or human intervention) is required to render these relations explicit. Note that the PTB encoding provides some explicit information about grammatical role, in that subject is explicitly labeled (although its relation to the verb remains implicit in the structure), but most relations (e.g., object ) are left implicit. Relations among non-contiguous elements demand a special numbering mechanism to enable crossreference, as in the specification of the NP-SBJ of the embedded sentence by reference to the earlier NP-SBJ-1 node.",

We accomplish this by treating the description of any specific syntactic annotation scheme as a process involving several knowledge sources that interact at various levels. The process allows one to specify, on the one hand, the informational properties of the scheme (i.e., its capacity to represent a given piece of information), and, on the other, the way the scheme can be instantiated (e.g., as an XML document). Figure 3 shows the overall architecture of the XCES framework for syntactic annotation. Data Category Registry: Within the framework of the XCES we are establishing an inventory of data categories for syntactic annotation, initially based on the EAGLES Recommendations for Syntactic Annotation of Corpora (Leech et al., 1996) . Data categories are defined using RDF descriptions that formalize the properties associated with each. The categories are organized in a hierarchy, from general to specific. For example, a general dependent relation may be defined, which may have one of the possible values argument or modifier; argument in turn may have the possible values subject, object, or complement; etc. 5 Note that RDF descriptions function much like class definitions in an object-oriented programming language: they provide, effectively, templates that describe how objects may be instantiated, but do not constitute the objects themselves. Thus, in a document containing an actual annotation, several objects with the type argument may be instantiated, each with a different value. The RDF schema ensures that each instantiation of argument is recognized as a sub-class of dependent and inherits the appropriate properties.",

Because XMLencoded annotated corpora are increasingly used for interchange between processing and analytic tools, we are developing XSLT scripts for mapping, and extraction of annotated data, import/export of (partially) annotated material, and integration of results of external tools into existing annotated data in XML. Tools for editing annotations in the abstract format, which automatically generate virtual AML from Data Category and Dialect Specifications, are already under development in the context of work on the Terminological Markup Language, and a tool for automatically generating RDF specifications for user-specified data categories has already been developed in the SALT project.9 Several freely distributed interpreters for XSLT have also been developed (e.g., xt10 , Xalan11 ). In practice, annotators and users of annotated corpora will rarely see XML and RDF instantiations of annotated data; rather, they will access the data via interfaces that automatically generate, interpret, and display the data in easy-to-read formats.",

The model enforces clear distinctions between implicit and explicit information (e.g., functional relations implied by structural relations in constituent analyses), and phrasal and functional relations. It is alarmingly common for annotation schemes to represent these different kinds of information in the same way, rendering their distinction computationally intractable (even if they are perfectly understandable by the informed human reader). Hand-developed annotation schemes used in treebanks are often described informally in guidebooks for annotators, leaving considerable room for variation; for example, Charniak (1996) notes that the PTB implicitly contains more than 10,000 contextfree rules, most of which are used only once. Comparison and transduction of schemes becomes virtually impossible under such circumstances. While requiring that annotators make relations explicit and consider the mapping to the XCES abstract format increases overhead, we feel that the exercise will help avoid such problems and can only lead to greater coherence, consistency, and inter-operability among annotation schemes.",
