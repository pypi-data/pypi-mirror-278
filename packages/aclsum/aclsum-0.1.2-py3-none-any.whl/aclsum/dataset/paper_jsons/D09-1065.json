For this purpose, corpus models have been tested on datasets that are based on semantic judgements (metalinguistic or meta-cognitive intuitions about synonymy, semantic distance, category-membership) or behavioural experiments (semantic priming, property generation, free association). While all these data are valuable, they are indirect reflections of semantic knowledge, and when the predictions they make diverge from those of corpora, interpretation is problematic: is the corpus model missing essential aspects of semantics, or are non-semantic factors biasing the data elicited from informants?",

Differences have also been found in response to auditorily or visually presented words of different lexical classes, such as abstract/concrete, and verb/noun (Pulverm\u00fcller, 2002) . But interpretation of such group results remains somewhat difficult, as they may be consistent with more than one distinction: the natural/artefactual division just mentioned, may rather be between living/nonliving entities, dynamic/static entities, or be based on embodied experience (e.g. manipulable or not).",

The work presented here builds on two strands of previous work: Murphy et al. (2008) use EEG data to perform semantic categorisation on single stimuli; and Mitchell et al. (2008) introduce an fMRIbased method that detects word level distinctions by learning associations between features of neural activity and semantic features derived from a corpus. We combine these innovations by introducing a method that extracts featural representations from the EEG signal, and uses corpusbased models to predict word level distinctions in patterns of EEG activity. The proposed method achieves a performance level significantly above chance (also when distinguishing between concepts from the same semantic category, e.g., dog and cat), and approaching that achieved with fMRI.",

The next section describes a simple behavioural experiment where Italian-speaking participants had to name photographic images of mammals and tools while their EEG activity was being recorded, and continues to detail how the rich and multidimensional signals collected were reduced to a small set of optimally informative features using a new method. Section 3 describes a series of corpus-based semantic models derived from both a raw-text web corpus, and from various parsings of a conventional corpus. In Section 4 we describe the training of a series of linear models, that each learn the associations between a set of corpus semantic features and an individual EEG activity feature. By combining these models it is possible to predict the EEG activity pattern for a single unseen word, and compare this to the observed pattern for the corresponding concept. Results (Section 5) show that these predictions succeed at a level significantly above chance, both for coarser distinctions between words in different superordinate categories (e.g., differentiating between drill and gorilla), and, at least for the model based on the larger web corpus, for those within the same category (e.g., drill vs spanner, koala vs gorilla).",

Seven participants (five male and two female; age range 25-33; all with college education) performed a silent naming task. Each of them was presented 1 on screen with a series of contrastnormalised greyscale photographs of tools (garden and work tools) and land mammals (excluding emotionally valent domesticated animals and 1 Using the E-Prime software package: http://www. pstnet.com/e-prime/. predators), for which they had to think of the most appropriate name (see figure 1 ). They were not explicitly asked to group the entities into superordinate categories, or to concentrate on their semantic properties, but completing the task involved resolving each picture to its corresponding concept. Images remained on screen until a keyboard response was received from the participant to indicate a suitable label had been found, and presentations were interleaved with three second rest periods. Thirty stimuli in each of the two classes were each presented six times, in random order, to give a total of 360 image presentations in the session. Response rates were over 95%, and a post-session questionnaire determined that participants agreed on image labels in approximately 90% of cases. English terms for the concepts used are listed below. The EEG signals were recorded at 500Hz from 64 scalp locations based on the 10-20 standard montage. 2 The EEG recording computer and stimulus presentation computer were synchronised by means of parallel port transmitted triggers. After the experiment, pre-processing of the recorded signals was carried out using the EEGLAB package (Delorme and Makeig, 2003) : signals were band-pass filtered at 1-50Hz to remove slow drifts and high-frequency noise, and then down-sampled to 120Hz. An ICA decomposition was subsequently applied (Makeig et al., 1996) , and signal components due to eye-movements were manually identified and removed.",

A z-score normalisation is carried out across all Figure 2 : Mean rank of selected features in the time/frequency space (left panel) and on the scalp (right panel) for participant E stimulus presentations to equalise variance across frequencies and times: to control both for the lowpass filtering action of the skull, and for the reduced synchronicity of activity at increasing latencies. For each stimulus a mean is then taken over each of six presentations to arrive at a more reliable power estimate for each feature. 3The feature ranking method used in Mitchell et al. (2008) evaluates the extent to which the relationship among stimuli is stable across across presentations, using a correlational measure,4 but preliminary analyses with this selection method on EEG features proved disappointing. Here, two additional ranking criteria are used: each feature is evaluated for its noisiness (the amount of power variation seen across presentations of the same stimulus), and for its distinctiveness (the amount of variation in power estimates across different stimuli). A combination of these three strategies is used to rank the features by their informativeness, and the top 50 features are then selected for each participant. 5A qualitative evaluation of the feature selection strategy can be carried out by examining the distribution of features selected. Figure 2 shows the distribution of selected features over the time/frequency spectrum (left panel), and over the scalp (right panel -viewed from above, with the nose pointing upwards). The distribution seen is Figure 3 : First two components of principal components analysis of selected features for participant E (crosses: mammals; circles: tools) plausible in reference to previous work: lower frequencies (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999) , latencies principally in the first few hundred milliseconds (Kiefer, 2001) , and activity in the visual centres at the rear of the head, as well as parietal areas (Pulverm\u00fcller, 2005) . A principal components analysis can also be performed on the selected features to see if they reflect any plausible semantic space. As figure 3 shows, the feature selection stage has captured quite faithfully the mammal/tool distinction in a totally unsupervised fashion.",

From this, we extracted four models where nominal concepts are represented in terms of patterns of co-occurrence with verbs (we collected statistics for the top 20,000 most common nouns in the corpus, including the concepts used as stimuli in the silent nam-ing experiment, and the top 5,000 verbs). We first re-implemented a \"classic\" window-based word space model (Sahlgren, 2006) , referred to below as repubblica-window, where each noun lemma is represented by its co-occurrence with verb lemmas within the maximum span of a sentence, with no more than one other intervening noun. The repubblica-position model is similar, but it also records the position of the verb with respect to the noun (so that X-usare \"X-use\" and usare-X \"use-X\" count as different features), analogously to the seminal HAL model (Lund and Burgess, 1996) . It has been shown that models that take the syntactic relation between a target word and a collocate feature into account can outperform \"flat\" models in some tasks (Pad\u00f3 and Lapata, 2007) . The next two models are based on the dependency parse of the la Repubblica corpus documented by Lenci (2009) . We only counted as collocates those verbs that were linked to nouns by a direct path (such as subject and object) or via preposition-mediated paths (e.g., tagliare con forbici \"to cut with scissors\"), and where the paths were among the top 30 most frequent in the corpus. In the repubblica-depfilter model, we record co-occurrence with verbs that are linked to the nouns by one of the top 30 paths, but we do not preserve the paths themselves in the features. This is analogous to the model proposed by Pad\u00f3 and Lapata (2007) . In the repubblica-deppath model, we preserve the paths as part of the features (so that subj-uccidere \"subj-kill\" and objuccidere count as different features), analogously to Lin (1998), Curran and Moens (2002) and others.

This only works if we have a very limited number of features (or else we would have more parameters to estimate than data-points to estimate them). The Repubblica-based models have thousands of features (one per verb collocate, or verb+path collocate). We adopt two strategies to select a reduced number of features. In the topfeat versions, we first pick the 50 features that have the highest association with each of the target concepts. We then count in how many of these concept-specific top lists a feature occurs, and we pick the 25 features that occur in the largest number of them. The intuition is that this should give us a good trade-off between how characteristic the features are (we only use features that are highly associated with some of our concepts), and their generalization capabilities (we pick features that are associated with multiple concepts). Randomly selected examples of the features extracted in this way for the various Repubblica models are reported in Table 2 .",

We apply the SVD to matrices that include the top 20,000 most frequent nouns in the corpus (including our target concepts) since the quality of the resulting reduced model should improve if we can exploit richer patterns of correlations among the columns -verbs -across rows -nouns (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Sch\u00fctze, 1997) . In the svd versions of our models, we pick as features the top 25 left singular vectors, weighted by the corresponding singular values. These features do not have a straightforward interpretation, but they tend to group verb meanings that belong to broad semantic domains. For example, among the original verbs that are most strongly correlated with one of the top singular vectors of repubblicawindow we find giocare \"play\", vincere \"win\" and perdere \"lose\". Another singular vector is associated with ammontare \"amount\", costare \"cost\", pagare \"pay\", etc. One of the top singular vectors of repubblica-deppath is strongly correlated with in+scendere \"descend into\", in+mettere \"put into\", in+entrare \"enter into\", though not all singular vectors are so clearly characterized by the verbs they correlate with.",

We use the method of least squared errors to learn the weights that maximize the fit of the model.

Its coarse temporal resolution (of the order of several seconds), makes it ill-suited to analysing on-line linguistic processes. EEG on the other hand, despite its low spatial resolution (several centimetres), gives millisecond-level temporal resolution, Finally, there is no prospect of fMRI being miniaturised, while wearable EEG systems are already becoming commercially available, making experimentation in more ecological settings a possibility (e.g., playing with a child, meeting at a desk, walking around).

A second limitation of our present methodology is that it is constrained to use very small numbers of semantic features, which limits its applicability. For example it is hard to conceive of a small set of verbs, or other parts-ofspeech, whose co-occurrence patterns could successfully characterise the full range of meaning found in the human lexicon.
