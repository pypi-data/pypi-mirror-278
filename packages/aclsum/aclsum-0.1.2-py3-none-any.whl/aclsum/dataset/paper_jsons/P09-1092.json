In some cases, it can be relatively straightforward to automatically detect these features (i.e. in the case of definiteness, this is a syntactic property). The more complex the feature, the more difficult it is to automatically detect. It is common knowledge that information status1 (henceforth, IS) has a strong influence on syntax and word order; for instance, in inversions, where the subject follows some preposed element, Birner (1994) reports that the preposed element must not be newer in the discourse than the subject. We would like to be able to use information related to IS in the automatic generation of German text. Ideally, we would automatically annotate text with IS labels and learn from this data. Unfortunately, however, to date, there has been little success in automatically annotating text with IS.",

Specifically, we look at the problem from a more general perspective by computing an asymmetry ratio for each pair of IS categories. Results show that there are a large number of pairs exhibiting clear ordering preferences when co-occurring in the same clause. The question then becomes, without being able to automatically detect these IS category pairs, can we, nevertheless, take advantage of these strong asymmetric patterns in generation. We investigate the (automatically detectable) morphosyntactic characteristics of each asymmetric IS pair and integrate these syntactic asymmetric properties into the generation process.",

In generation (or more specifically, surface realisation) ranking, we take an abstract representation of a sentence (for example, as produced by a machine translation or automatic summarisation system), produce a number of alternative string realisations corresponding to that input and use some model to choose the most likely string. We take the model outlined in Cahill et al. (2007) , a log-linear model based on the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) Framework (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) . LFG has two main levels of represen- The input to the generation system is an F-Structure. A hand-crafted, bi-directional LFG of German (Rohrer and Forst, 2006 ) is used to generate all possible strings (licensed by the grammar) for this input. As the grammar is hand-crafted, it is designed only to parse (and therefore) generate grammatical strings. 2 The task of the realisation ranking system is then to choose the most likely string. Cahill et al. (2007) describe a loglinear model that uses linguistically motivated features and improves over a simple tri-gram language model baseline. We take this log-linear model as our starting point. 3 2 There are some rare instances of the grammar parsing and therefore also generating ungrammatical output.",

Different classification systems have been proposed in the literature; see Riester (2008a) for a comparison of several IS labelling schemes and Riester (2008b) for a new proposal based on criteria from presupposition theory. In the work described here, we use the scheme of Riester (2008b) .

In doing so, we distinguish the numbers for \"X preceding Y \" (= A) and \"Y preceding X\" (= B). The larger group is referred to as the dominant order. Subsequently, we compute a ratio indicating the degree of asymmetry between the two orders. If, for instance, the dominant pattern occurs 20 times (A) and the reverse pattern only 5 times (B), the asymmetry ratio B/A is 0.25. Table 3 : Asymmetric pairs of IS labels Table 3 gives the top asymmetry pairs down to a ratio of about 1:3 as well as, down at the bottom, the pairs that are most evenly distributed. This means that the top pairs exhibit strong ordering preferences and are, hence, unevenly distributed in German sentences. For instance, the ordering D-GIVEN-PRONOUN before INDEF-REL (top line), shown in Example (8), occurs 19 times in the examined corpus while there is no example in the corpus for the reverse order.7 ",

Again we remove any inconsistent asymmetries and only choose asymmetries with a ratio of higher than 0.4. The top asymmetries are given in Table 8 . For each asymmetry, we create a new feature X precedes Y. This results in a total of 66 features. Of these 30 overlap with the features used in the above experiment. We do not include the features extracted in the first attempt in this experiment. The same training procedure is carried out and we test on the same heldout test set of 261 sen-tences. The results are given in Table 9 . Finally, we combine the two lists of features and evaluate, these results are also presented in Table 9 . They show that although the syntactic asymmetries alone contribute to an improvement over the baseline, the gain is not as large as when the syntactic asymmetries are constrained to correspond to IS label asymmetries (Model 1). 9 Interestingly, the combination of the lists of features does not result in an improvement over Model 1.

Ideally, we would like to be able to use the IS asymmetries directly as features, however, without any means of automatically annotating new text with these categories, this is impossible. Our experiments were designed to test, whether we can achieve an improvement in the generation of German text, without a fully labelled corpus, using the insight that at least some IS categories correspond to morphosyntactic characteristics that can be easily identified. We do not claim to go beyond this level to the point where true IS labels would be used, rather we attempt to provide a crude approximation of IS using only morphosyntactic information. To be able to fully automatically annotate text with IS labels, one would need to supplement the morphosyntactic features 9 The difference may also be due to the fewer features used in the second experiment. However, this emphasises, that the asymmetries gleaned from syntactic information alone are not strong enough to be able to determine the prevailing order of constituents. When we take the IS labels into account, we are honing in on a particular subset of interesting syntactic asymmetries.",

In a limited domain setting, Prevost (1996) describes a two-tiered information structure representation. During the high level planning stage of generation, using a small knowledge base, elements in the discourse are automatically marked as new or given. Contrast and focus are also assigned automatically. These markings influence the final string generated. We are focusing on a broad-coverage system, and do not use any external world-knowledge resources. Van Deemter and Odijk (1997) annotate the syntactic component from which they are generating with information about givenness. This information is determined by detecting contradictions and parallel sentences. Pulman (1997) also uses information about parallelism to predict word order. In contrast, we only look at one sentence when we approximate information status, future work will look at cross sentential factors. Endriss and Klabunde (2000) describe a sentence planner for German that annotates the propositional input with discourse-related features in order to determine the focus, and thus influence word order and accentuation. Their system, again, is domainspecific (generating monologue describing a film plot) and requires the existence of a knowledge base. The same holds for Yampolska (2007) , who presents suggestions for generating information structure in Russian and Ukrainian football reports, using rules to determine parallel structures for the placement of contrastive accent, following similar work by Theune (1997) . While our paper does not address the generation of speech / accentuation, it is of course conceivable to employ the IS annotated radio news corpus from which we derived the label asymmetries (and which also exists in a spoken and prosodically annotated version) in a similar task of learning the correlations between IS labels and pitch accents. Finally, Bresnan et al. (2007) present work on predicting the dative alternation in English using 14 features relating to information status which were manually annotated in their corpus. In our work, we manually annotate a small corpus in order to learn generalisations. From these we learn features that approximate the generalisations, enabling us to apply them to large amounts of unseen data without further manual annotation.",

Since automatic annotation of IS labels themselves is not currently possible, we approximate the IS categories by their syntactic characteristics. By calculating strong asymmetries between pairs of IS labels, and establishing the most frequent syntactic characteristics of these asymmetries, we designed a new set of features for a log-linear ranking model. In comparison to a baseline model, we achieve statistically significant improvement in BLEU score. We showed that these improvements were not only due to the effect of purely syntactic asymmetries, but that the IS asymmetries were what drove the improved model.",
