In this paper, the task of aspect-level sentiment controllable style transfer is introduced, where each of the aspect-level sentiments can individually be controlled at the output. To achieve this goal, a BERT-based encoder-decoder architecture with saliency weighted polarity injection is proposed, with unsupervised training strategies, such as ABSA masked-languagemodelling.

Recent interest in Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) (Pontiki et al., 2014) has shown that sentiment information can vary within a sentence, with differing sentiments expressed towards different aspect terms of target entities (e.g. 'food', 'service' in a restaurant domain). We introduce the task of aspect-level sentiment transfer -the task of rewriting sentences to transfer them from a given set of aspect-term polarities (such as 'positive sentiment' towards the service of a restaurant and a 'positive sentiment' towards the taste of the food) to a different set of aspect-term polarities (such as 'negative sentiment' towards the service of a restaurant and a 'positive' sentiment towards the taste of the food). This is a more challenging task than regular style transfer as the style attributes here are not the overall attributes for the whole sentence, but are localized to specific parts of the sentence, and multiple opposing at-tributes could be present within the same sentence. The target of the transformation made needs to be localized and the other content expressed in the rest of the sentence need to be preserved at the output. An example of the task is shown in Figure 1 .",

The notion of styles in natural language can be used to refer to the attributes, such as sentiment, formality in content, emotion, sarcasm, etc. Similar to the sentiment, these other attributes can also be present localized to different entities taking differing values at each location. If we consider the style 'emotion' with the example \"Although Alice infuriates me with her prattle and Bob scares me, I am quite happy about how things are turning out.\" -A single piece of text (such as a single sentence) can express an emotion, such as 'happiness' about an event while expressing 'fear' towards some entity and 'anger' towards a second entity. This shows that style transfer in language needs a more nuanced understanding. Especially when generating larger pieces of text, multiple such styles could intermingle, and differing styles can often be present together when discussing different topics and entities. Our work intends to take the first step towards a more controllable form of finegrained style transfer with the task of aspect-level sentiment style transfer.",

Most of the previous works involving sentiment transfer (Li et al., 2018b; Yang et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Prabhumoye et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019) consider the style that is present throughout the sentence and seek to transfer only the overall sentiment polarities expressed. Tian et al. (2018) proposed a new training objective for content preservation during style transfer. They used Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging to collect nouns at inputs, and expect them to be present at the output for content preservation. To achieve this, they proposed a PoS preservation constraint and 'Content Conditional Language Modelling'. They tested their system on sentiment style transfer task. Wang et al. (2019) proposed a method that can also control the degree of polarity transfer in a sentence with multiple aspect categories present in it. Unlike their task which deals with predefined aspect categories, our task deals with opinion target expressions. Aspect categories are coarse entities that are few in number and predefined for a certain domain, while aspect-terms or opinion target expressions are fine-grained entities that are present in the text. They also did not investigate selectively transferring the polarity over a subset of aspects with multiple differing polarities at the output and only invert the overall polarity expressed by the sentence. Our method works across thousands of unique opinion target expressions (Table 1 shows the number unique target aspects present in each of our datasets).Our method also does not need these to be predefined, and so could be used to control the polarities of previously unseen target expressions as well.",

(2020) , authors showed that the hidden states of the encoder can be edited by adding weighted vectors to indicate subjective-bias, before being input to the decoder. They proposed this as a method to join the results from two sub-modules in their system. Here, we extend this to cover multiple attributes -the 'positive' and 'negative' sentiments, and substitute the supervised model they train with saliency-based weights. We inject (add) weighted amounts of two vectors corresponding to these two attributes to edit the hidden states output by the encoder. For each aspect, the vector added corresponds to the desired target polarity of this aspect, and the amount added to a given token depends on the saliency-based weight for this token calculated from the gradient for this aspect's polarity from a classification model (described in Section 4.1.1). More formally, the polarity injection is calculated from equation 1. H = [h 1 , h 2 , . . . h k ] that denotes the hidden-state output from the encoder, and H = [h 1 , h 2 , . . . h k ] are the new hidden-states calculated after polarity-injection. The number p ij denotes the saliency-based weightage for token j with respect to aspect i. Figure 3 shows the polarityinjection architecture. v pos and v neg are the special vector-embeddings, which have the same size as the hidden dimension, and trained to denote the positive and negative sentiment, respectively.",

The models with polarity injection are especially better at transferring sentiments when three or more aspects are present, showing that the polarity signals are useful in localizing the style attributes with multiple targets present. The model using saliencybased weighting for the polarity injection has a significantly higher classifier score. This could be because of the saliency information acting like an adversarial white-box attack on the classifier, making it easier to obtain higher classifier scores.",

The absence of attribute markers also makes it harder to convert sentiment. Most outputs with low Con and Gra scores were found to contain very long sentences.
