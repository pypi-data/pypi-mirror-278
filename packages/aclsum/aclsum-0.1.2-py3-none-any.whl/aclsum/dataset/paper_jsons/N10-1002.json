The general approach of mining features from partial analyses is applicable to a range of lexical acquisition tasks, and is particularly suited to domain-specific lexical tuning and lexical acquisition using lowcoverage grammars. As an illustration of the functionality of our proposed technique, we develop a lexical acquisition model for English verb particle constructions which operates over unlexicalised features mined from a partial parsing chart.

However, error mining is very much oriented towards grammar engineering: its results are a mixture of different (mistreated) linguistic phenomena together with engineering errors for the grammar engineer to work through and act upon. Additionally, it generally does not provide any insight into the cause of the parser failure, and it is difficult to identify specific language phenomena from the output.",

For comparison, we parse the same sentence set using a state-of-the-art statistical parser, and extract the VPCs from the parser output. Our results show that our chart mining method produces a model which is superior to the treebank parser.",

(1999) and Zhang et al. (2007a) , where partial parsing models were proposed to select a set of passive edges that together cover the input sequence. Compared to these approaches, our proposed chart mining technique is more general and can be adapted to specific tasks and domains. While we experiment exclusively with an HPSG grammar in this paper, it is important to note that the proposed method can be applied to any grammar formalism which is compatible with chart parsing, and where it is possible to describe an unlexicalised lexical entry for the different categories of lexical item that are to be extracted (see Section 3.2 for details).",

Also, while conventional collocations generally take the form of compound nouns or adjective-noun combinations with relatively simple syntactic structure, VPCs occur with a range of valences. Furthermore, VPCs are highly productive in English and vary in use across domains, making them a prime target for lexical acquisition (Deh\u00e9, 2002; Baldwin, 2005; Baldwin and Kim, 2009) .",

For example, battle on would be classified as compositional, as the semantics of battle is identical to that for the simplex verb, and the semantics of on corresponds to the continuative sense of the word as occurs productively in VPCs (cf., walk/dance/drive/govern/... on). With non-compositional VPCs, on the other hand, the semantics of the VPC is somehow removed from that of the parts.

A parsing chart is a data structure that records all the (complete or incomplete) intermediate parsing results. Every passive edge on the parsing chart represents a complete local analysis covering a sub-string of the input, while each active edge predicts a potential local analysis. In this view, a full analysis is merely a passive edge that spans the whole input and satisfies certain root con-ditions. The bottom-up chart parser starts with edges instantiated from lexical entries corresponding to the input words. The grammar rules are used to incrementally create longer edges from smaller ones until no more edges can be added to the chart. Standardly, the parser returns only outputs that correspond to passive edges in the parsing chart that span the full input string. For those inputs without a full-spanning edge, no output is generated, and the chart becomes the only source of parsing information.",

                "text": "There are two potential challenges for the chartmining technique. First, there is potentially a huge number of parsing edges in the chart. For instance, when parsing with a large precision grammar like the HPSG English Resource Grammar (ERG, Flickinger ( 2002)), it is not unusual for a 20-word sentence to receive over 10,000 passive edges. In order to achieve high efficiency in parsing (as well as generation), ambiguity packing is usually used to reduce the number of productive passive edges on the parsing chart (Tomita, 1985) . For constraint-based grammar frameworks like LFG and HPSG, subsumption-based packing is used to achieve a higher packing ratio (Oepen and Carroll, 2000) , but this might also potentially lead to an inconsistent packed parse forest that does not unpack successfully. For chart mining, this means that not all passive edges are directly accessible from the chart. Some of them are packed into others, and the derivatives of the packed edges are not generated. Because of the ambiguity packing, zero or more local analyses may exist for each passive edge on the chart, and the cross-combination of the packed daughter edges is not guaranteed to be compatible. As a result, expensive unification operations must be reapplied during the unpacking phase. Carroll and Oepen (2005) and Zhang et al. (2007b) have proposed efficient k-best unpacking algorithms that can selectively extract the most probable readings from the packed parse forest according to a discrimina-tive parse disambiguation model, by minimising the number of potential unifications. The algorithm can be applied to unpack any passive edges. Because of the dynamic programming used in the algorithm and the hierarchical structure of the edges, the cost of the unpacking routine is empirically linear in the number of desired readings, and O(1) when invoked more than once on the same edge.",

How to effectively extract the indicative features for a specific language phenomenon is a very task-specific question, as we will show in the context of the VPC extraction task in Section 3.2. However, general strategies can be applied to generate parse ranking scores on each passive edge. The most widely used parse ranking model is the loglinear model (Abney, 1997; Johnson et al., 1999; Toutanova et al., 2002) . When the model does not use non-local features, the accumulated score on a sub-tree under a certain (unpacked) passive edge can be used to approximate the probability of the partial analysis conditioned on the sub-string within that span. 3",

These four lexical entries represent the two VPC valences we wish to distinguish between in the VPC extraction task, and the competing simplex verb candidates. Based on these lexical types, the features we extract with chart mining are summarised in Table 1 . The maximal constituent (MAXCONS) of a lexical entry is defined to be the passive edge that is an ancestor of the lexical entry edge that: (i) must span over the particle, and (ii) has maximal span length. In the case of a tie, the edge with the highest disambiguation score is selected as the MAXCONS. If there is no edge found on the chart that spans over both the verb and the particle, the MAXCONS is set to be NULL, with a MAXSPAN of 0, MAXLEVEL of 0 and MAXCRANK of 4 (see Table 1 ).

The parse disambiguation model we use is also trained on the LOGON Treebank. Since the parser has no access to any of the verbs under investigation (due to the DUMMY-V substitution), those VPC types attested in the LOGON Treebank do not directly impact on the model's performance. The chart mining feature extraction process took over 10 CPU days, and collected a total of 44K events for 4,090 candidate VPC triples. 4 5-fold cross validation is used to train/test the model. As stated above (Section 2), the VPC triples attested in the WSJ training sections of the Penn Treebank are excluded in each testing fold for comparison with the Charniak parser-based model (see Section 4.2).",

The Charniak parser-based extraction method performs reasonably well, especially in the VPC+valence extraction task over the FULL task, where the recall was higher than the chart mining method. Although not reported here, we observe a marked improvement in the results for the Charniak parser when the VPC types attested in the WSJ are not filtered from the test set. This indicates that the statistical parser relies heavily on lexicalised VPC information, while the chart mining model is much more syntax-oriented. In error analysis of the data, we observed that the Charniak parser was noticeably more accurate at extracting VPCs where the verb was frequent (our method, of course, did not have access to the base frequency of the simplex verb), underlining again the power of lexicalisation. This points to two possibilities: (1) the potential for our method to similarly benefit from lexicalisation if we were to remove the constraint on ignoring any pre-existing lexical entries for the verb; and (2) the possibility for hybridising between lexicalised models for frequent verbs and unlexicalised models for infrequent verbs. Having said this, it is important to reinforce that lexical acquisition is usually performed in the absence of lexicalised probabilities, as if we have prior knowledge of the lexical item, there is no need to extract it. In this sense, the first set of results in Table 3 over Gold VPCs are the most informative, and illustrate the potential of the proposed approach.",

With MWE extraction, e.g., even though some MWEs are fixed and have no internal syntactic variability, such as ad hoc, there is a very large proportion of idioms that allow various degrees of internal variability, and with a variable number of elements. For example, the idiom spill the beans allows internal modification (spill mountains of beans), passivisation (The beans were spilled in the latest edition of the report), topicalisation (The beans, the opposition spilled), and so forth (Sag et al., 2002) . In general, however, the exact degree of variability of an idiom is difficult to predict (Riehemann, 2001) .

The chart mining approach we propose in this paper is couched in the bottom-up chart parsing paradigm, based exclusively on passive edges. As future work, we would also like to look into the top-level active edges (those active edges that are never completed), as an indication of failed assumptions. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate the applicability of the technique in other parsing strategies, e.g., head-corner or left-corner parsing. Finally, it would also be interesting to investigate whether by using the features we acquire from chart mining enhanced with information on the prevalence of certain patterns, we could achieve performance improvements over broader-coverage treebank parsers such as the Charniak parser.",
