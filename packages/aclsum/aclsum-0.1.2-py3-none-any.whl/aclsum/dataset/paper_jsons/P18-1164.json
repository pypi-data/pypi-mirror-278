In NMT, the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model learns word embeddings for both source and target words synchronously. However, as illustrated in Figure 1 , source and target word embeddings are at the two ends of a long information processing procedure. The individual associations between them will gradually become loose due to the separation of source-side hidden states (represented by h 1 , . . . , h T in Fig. 1 ) and a target- side hidden state (represented by s t in Fig. 1 ). As a result, in the absence of a more tight interaction between source and target word pairs, the seq2seq model in NMT produces tentative translations that contain incorrect alignments of source words with target counterparts that are non-admissible equivalents in any possible translation context. Differently from SMT, in NMT an attention model is adopted to help align output with input words. The attention model is based on the estimation of a probability distribution over all input words for each target word. Word alignments with attention weights can then be easily deduced from such distributions and support the translation. Nevertheless, sometimes one finds translations by NMT that contain surprisingly wrong word alignments, that would unlikely occur in SMT.",

In the top example, the NMT seq2seq model incorrectly aligns the target side end of sentence mark eos to \u4e0b\u65ec/late with a high attention weight (0.80 in this example) due to the failure of appropriately capturing the similarity, or the lack of it, between the source word \u4e0b\u65ec/late and the target eos. It is also worth noting that, as \u672c/this and \u6708/month end up not being translated in this example, inappropriate alignment of target side eos is likely the responsible factor for under translation in NMT as the decoding process ends once a target eos is generated. Statistics on our development data show that as much as 50% of target side eos do not properly align to source side eos.",

Despite these approaches having a somewhat similar motivation of using pairs of translation equivalents to benefit the NMT translation, in our new bridging approach we do not use extra resources in the NMT model, but let the model itself learn the similarity of word pairs from the training data. 4Besides, there exist also studies on the learning of cross-lingual embeddings for machine translation. Mikolov et al. (2013) propose to first learn distributed representation of words from large monolingual data, and then learn a linear mapping between vector spaces of languages. Gehring et al. (2017) introduce source word embeddings to predict target words. These approaches are somewhat similar to our source-side bridging model. However, inspired by the insight of shortening the distance between source and target embeddings in the seq2seq processing chain, in the present paper we propose more strategies to bridge source and target word embeddings and with better results.",
