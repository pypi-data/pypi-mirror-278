Further, these approaches typically depend on specific semantic signals such as sentiment-or topic-labels for their objective functions. While these methods have been shown to work in some cases, the need for parse trees and annotated data limits such approaches to resourcefortunate languages. Our novel method for learning compositional vectors removes these requirements, and as such can more easily be applied to low-resource languages. Specifically, we attempt to learn semantics from multilingual data. The idea is that, given enough parallel data, a shared representation of two parallel sentences would be forced to capture the common elements between these two sentences. What parallel sentences share, of course, are their semantics. Naturally, different languages express meaning in different ways. We utilise this diversity to abstract further from mono-lingual surface realisations to deeper semantic representations. We exploit this semantic similarity across languages by defining a bilingual (and trivially multilingual) energy as follows.",

While most approaches to compositional distributed semantics end at the word level, our model extends to document-level learning quite naturally, by recursively applying the composition and objective function (Equation 2) to compose sentences into documents. This is achieved by first computing semantic representations for each sentence in a document. Next, these representations are used as inputs in a higher-level CVM, computing a semantic representation of a document (Figure 2 ). This recursive approach integrates documentlevel representations into the learning process. We can thus use corpora of parallel documentsregardless of whether they are sentence aligned or not-to propagate a semantic signal back to the individual words. If sentence alignment is available, of course, the document-signal can simply be combined with the sentence-signal, as we did with the experiments described in \u00a75.3.",

(2012) , with the exception that we learn our embeddings using solely the Europarl data and use the Reuters corpora only during for classifier training and testing. Each document in the classification task is represented by the average of the d-dimensional representations of all its sentences. We train the multiclass classifier using an averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) with the same settings as in Klementiev et al. (2012) We present results from four models. The ADD model is trained on 500k sentence pairs of the English-German parallel section of the Europarl corpus. The ADD+ model uses an additional 500k parallel sentences from the English-French corpus, resulting in one million English sentences, each paired up with either a German or a French sentence, with BI and BI+ trained accordingly. The motivation behind ADD+ and BI+ is to investigate whether we can learn better embeddings by introducing additional data from other languages. A similar idea exists in machine translation where English is frequently used to pivot between other languages (Cohn and Lapata, 2007) .",

The results of this experiment are in Table 2 . When comparing the results between the ADD model and the models trained using the documentlevel error signal, the benefit of this additional signal becomes clear. The joint training mode leads to a relative improvement when training on English data and evaluating in a second language. This suggests that the joint mode improves the quality of the English embeddings more than it affects the L2-embeddings. More surprising, perhaps, is the relative performance between the ADD and BI composition functions, especially when compared to the results in \u00a75.2, where the BI models relatively consistently performed better.

(2013) proposed a bag-of-words autoencoder model, where the bagof-words representation in one language is used to train the embeddings in another. By placing their vocabulary in a binary branching tree, the probabilistic setup of this model is similar to that of Mnih and Hinton (2009) . Similarly, Sarath Chandar et al. (2013) train a cross-lingual encoder, where an autoencoder is used to recreate words in two languages in parallel. This is effectively the linguistic extension of Ngiam et al. (2011) , who used a similar method for audio and video data. Hermann and Blunsom (2014) propose a largemargin learner for multilingual word representations, similar to the basic additive model proposed here, which, like the approaches above, relies on a bag-of-words model for sentence representations. Klementiev et al. (2012) , our baseline in \u00a75.2, use a form of multi-agent learning on wordaligned parallel data to transfer embeddings from one language to another. Earlier work, Haghighi et al. (2008) , proposed a method for inducing bilingual lexica using monolingual feature representations and a small initial lexicon to bootstrap with. This approach has recently been extended by Mikolov et al. (2013a) , Mikolov et al. (2013b) , who developed a method for learning transformation matrices to convert semantic vectors of one language into those of another. Is was demonstrated that this approach can be applied to improve tasks related to machine translation. Their CBOW model is also worth noting for its similarities to the ADD composition function used here. Using a slightly different approach, Zou et al.
