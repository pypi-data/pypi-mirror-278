Kageura & Umino, 1996) . However, the basic quantitative nature of terminological structure, which is essential for terminological theory and applications, has not yet been exploited. The static quantitative descriptions are not sufficient, as there are terms which do not appear in the sample. So it is crucial to establish some models, by which the terminological structure beyond the sample size can be properly described.",
