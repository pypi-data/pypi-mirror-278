In this task we want a recommendation system to automatically discover the entities (e.g., a person, location, organi-zation etc.) that interest a user when reading a document and to highlight the corresponding text spans, referred to as keywords afterwards. We show in this study that document semantics are among the most important factors that influence what is perceived as interesting to the user.

The task is challenging because the same keywords often refer to different entities, and interesting supplementary information to the highlighted entity is highly sensitive to the semantic context. For example, \"Paul Simon\" can refer to many people, such as the singer and the senator. Consider an article about the music of Paul Simon and another about his life.

The model is deep because it employs a neural network with several hidden layers including a special convolutional-pooling structure to identify keywords and extract hidden semantic features at different levels of abstractions, layer by layer. The semantic representation is computed through a deep neural network after its training by backpropagation with respect to an objective tailored to the respective interestingness tasks. We obtain naturally occurring \"interest\" signals by observing Web browser transitions, from a source document to a target document, in Web usage logs of a commercial browser. Our training data is sampled from these transitions.",

                "text": "The use of the DSSM to model interestingness is motivated by the recent success of applying related deep neural networks to computer vision (Krizhevshy et al. 2012; Markoff, 2014) , speech recognition (Hinton et al. 2012 ), text processing (Collobert et al. 2011) , and Web search (Huang et al. 2013 ). Among them, (Huang et al. 2013 ) is most relevant to our work. They also use a deep neural network to map documents to feature vectors in a latent semantic space. However, their model is designed to represent the relevance between queries and documents, which differs from the notion of interestingness between documents studied in this paper. It is often the case that a user is interested in a document because it provides supplementary information about the entities or concepts she encounters when reading another document although the overall contents of the second documents is not highly relevant. For example, a user may be interested in knowing more about the history of University of Washington after reading the news about President Obama's visit to Seattle. To better model interestingness, we extend the model of Huang et al. (2013) in two significant aspects. First, while Huang et al. treat a document as a bag of words for semantic mapping, the DSSM treats a document as a sequence of words and tries to discover prominent keywords. These keywords represent the entities or concepts that might interest users, via the convolutional and max-pooling layers which are related to the deep models used for computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2013) and speech recognition (Deng et al., 2013a) but are not used in Huang et al.'s model. The DSSM then forms the high-level semantic representation of the whole document based on these keywords. Second, instead of directly computing the document relevance score using cosine similarity in the learned semantic space, as in Huang et al. (2013) , we feed the features derived from the semantic representations of documents to a ranker which is trained in a supervised manner. As a result, a document that is not highly relevant to another document a user is reading (i.e., the distance between their derived feature 1 We stress here that, although the click signal is available to form a dataset and a gold standard ranker (to be described in vectors is big) may still have a high score of interestingness because the former provides useful information about an entity mentioned in the latter. Such information and entity are encoded, respectively, by (some subsets of) the semantic features in their corresponding documents. In Sections 4 and 5, we empirically demonstrate that the aforementioned two extensions lead to significant quality improvements for the two interestingness tasks presented in this paper.",

It takes two steps to convert a document , which is a sequence of words, into a vector representation for the input layer of the network: (1) convert each word in to a word vector, and (2) build by concatenating these word vectors. To convert a word into a word vector, we first represent by a one-hot vector using a vocabulary that contains high frequent words ( 150K in this study). Then, following Huang et al. (2013) , we map to a separate tri-letter vector. Consider the word \"#dog#\", where # is a word boundary symbol. The nonzero elements in its triletter vector are \"#do\", \"dog\", and \"og#\". We then form the word vector of by concatenating its one-hot vector and its tri-letter vector. It is worth noting that the tri-letter vector complements the one-hot vector representation in two aspects. First, different OOV (out of vocabulary) words can be represented by tri-letter vectors with few collisions. Second, spelling variations of the same word can be mapped to the points that are close to each other in the tri-letter space. Although the number of unique English words on the Web is extremely large, the total number of distinct triletters in English is limited (restricted to the most frequent 30K in this study). As a result, incorporating tri-letter vectors substantially improves the representation power of word vectors while keeping their size small.",

The training stops if either is smaller than a preset threshold (0.0001) or the loss on training data can no longer be reduced significantly.

DSSM is the model described in Section 3 and DSSM_BOW is the model proposed by Huang et al. (2013) where documents are view as bag of words (BOW) and the convolutional and max-pooling layers are not used. The two other sources of semantic features are used as a point of comparison to the DSSM. One is a generative semantic model (Joint Transition Topic model, or JTT) (Gamon et al. 2013) . JTT is an LDA-style model (Blei et al. 2003 ) that is trained jointly on source and target documents linked by browsing transitions. JTT generates a total of 150 features from its latent variables, 50 each for the source topic model, the target topic model and the transition model. The other semantic model of contrast is a manually defined one, which we use to assess the effectiveness of automatically learned models against human modelers. To this effect, we use the page categories that editors assign in Wikipedia as semantic features (WCAT). These features number in the multiple thousands. Using features such as WCAT is not a viable solution in general since Wikipedia categories are not available for all documents.

First, we see in Table 1 that DSSM_BOW, which has the same network structure of Huang et al.'s model, is much weaker than DSSM, demonstrating the benefits of using convolutional and max-pooling layers to extract semantic features for the highlighting task. Second, we conduct several experiments by using the cosine scores between the output layers of DSSM for and as features (following the procedure in Section 3.3 for using the DSSM as a direct implementation of ). We found that adding the cosine features to NSF+DSSM does not lead to any improvement. We also combined NSF with solely the cosine features from DSSM (i.e., without the other semantic features drawn from its output layers). But we still found no improvement over using NSF alone. Thus, we conclude that for this task it is much more effective to feed the features derived from DSSM to a supervised ranker than directly computing the interestingness score using cosine similarity in the learned semantic space, as in Huang et al. (2013) .",

The semantic representation in BLTM is a distribution of hidden semantic topics. Such a distribution is learned using Maximum Likelihood Estimation in an unsupervised manner, i.e., maximizing the log-likelihood of the source-target document pairs in the training data. On the other hand, DSSM represents documents as points in a hidden semantic space using a supervised learning method, i.e., paired documents are closer in that latent space than unpaired ones.

To further verify our analysis, we inspect the results of a variant of DSSM, denoted as DSSM_BOW (Row 6), where the convolution and max-pooling layers are removed.

It has empirically been demonstrated in Gamon et al. (2013) that popularity is in fact a rather poor predictor for interestingness.

Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2010) propose the most original approach based on an unsupervised version of the deep neural network to discover the hierarchical semantic structure embedded in queries and documents. Huang et al. (2013) significantly extends the approach so that the deep neural network can be trained on large-scale query-document pairs giving much better performance. The use of the convolutional neural network for text processing, central to our DSSM, was also described in Collobert et al. (2011) and Shen et al. (2014) but with very different applications. The DSSM described in Section 3 can be viewed as a variant of the deep neural network models used in these previous studies.",

We obtain naturally occurring interest signals by observing Web browsing transitions where users click from one webpage to another. We propose to model this \"interestingness\" with a deep semantic similarity model (DSSM), based on deep neural networks with special convolutional-pooling structure, mapping source-target document pairs to feature vectors in a latent semantic space. We train the DSSM using browsing transitions between documents. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two interestingness tasks: automatic highlighting and contextual entity search. Our results on large-scale, real-world datasets show that the semantics of documents computed by the DSSM are important for modeling interestingness and that the new model leads to significant improvements on both tasks. DSSM is shown to outperform not only the classic document models that do not use (latent) semantics but also stateof-the-art topic models that do not have the deep and convolutional architecture characterizing the DSSM.",

To capture such signals, our model needs to be extended to adequately represent time series (e.g., causal relations and consequences of actions). One potentially effective model for such a purpose is based on the architecture of recurrent neural networks (e.g., Mikolov et al. 2010; Chen and Deng, 2014) , which can be incorporated into the deep semantic model proposed in this paper.",
