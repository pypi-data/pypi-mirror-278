With the larger goal of automatically constructing a Pan-Chinese lexical resource, this work aims at taking an existing semantic classificatory structure as leverage and incorporating new words into it. In particular, it is important to see if the classification could accommodate new words from heterogeneous data sources, and whether simple similarity measures and clustering methods could cope with such variation. We use the cosine function for similarity and test it on automatically classifying 120 target words from four regions, using different datasets for the extraction of feature vectors. The automatic classification results were evaluated against human judgement, and the performance was encouraging, with accuracy reaching over 85% in some cases. Thus while human judgement is not straightforward and it is difficult to create a Pan-Chinese lexicon manually, it is observed that combining simple clustering methods with the appropriate data sources appears to be a promising approach toward its automatic construction.",

To allow maximum versatility and portability, it is expected to document the core and universal substances of the language on the one hand, and also the more subtle variations found in different communities on the other. Different Chinese speech communities might share lexical items in the same form but with different meanings. For instance, the word \u5c45\u5c4b refers to general housing in Mainland China but specifically to housing under the Home Ownership Scheme in Hong Kong; and while the word \u4f4f\u623f is similar to \u5c45\u5c4b to mean general housing in Mainland China, it is rarely seen in the Hong Kong context.",

In particular, the feasibility depends on the following issues: (1) Can lexical items from various Chinese speech communities, that is, from such heterogeneous sources, be classified as effectively with methods shown to work for clustering closely related words from presumably the same, or homogenous, source?

There is usually no problem if both words and their contextual features are from the same data source. Since Tongyici Cilin (or simply Cilin hereafter) is based on the vocabulary used in Mainland China, it is not clear how often these words will be found in data from other places, and even if they are found, how well the feature vectors extracted could reflect the expected usage or sense. Our hypothesis is that it will be more effective to classify new words from Mainland China with respect to Cilin categories, than to do the same on new words from regions outside Mainland China. Furthermore, if this hypothesis holds, one would need to consider separate mechanisms to cluster heterogeneous regionspecific words in the Pan-Chinese context.",

In general, an accuracy of up to 85% could be reached with the top 15 candidates considered.

Previous work on automatic methods for building semantic lexicons could be divided into two main groups. One is automatic thesaurus acquisition, that is, to identify synonyms or topically related words from corpora based on various measures of similarity (e.g. Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Thelen and Riloff, 2002) . For instance, Lin (1998) used dependency relation as word features to compute word similarities from large corpora, and compared the thesaurus created in such a way with WordNet and Roget classes. Caraballo (1999) selected head nouns from conjunctions and appositives in noun phrases, and used the cosine similarity measure with a bottomup clustering technique to construct a noun hierarchy from text. Curran and Moens (2002) explored a new similarity measure for automatic thesaurus extraction which better compromises with the speed/performance tradeoff. You and Chen (2006) used a feature clustering method to create a thesaurus from a Chinese newspaper corpus.",

An early effort along this line is Hearst (1992) , who attempted to identify hyponyms from large text corpora, based on a set of lexico-syntactic patterns, to augment and critique the content of WordNet. Ciaramita (2002) compared several models in classifying nouns with respect to a simplified version of WordNet and signified the gain in performance with morphological features. For Chinese, Tseng (2003) proposed a method based on morphological similarity to assign a Cilin category to unknown words from the Sinica corpus which were not in the Chinese Electronic Dictionary and Cilin; but somehow the test data were taken from Cilin, and therefore could not really demonstrate the effectiveness with unknown words found in the Sinica corpus.",

Apart from this high accuracy, another unexpected observation is the lack of significant difference between Cos-RV-hk-hk and Cos-RV-hk-bj. One possible reason is that the relatively larger size of the Hong Kong subcorpus might have allowed enough features to be extracted even for the Cilin words. Nevertheless, the similar results from the two conditions might also suggest that the context in which Cilin words are used might be relatively similar in the Hong Kong subcorpus and the Beijing subcorpus, as compared with other communities. Similar trends were observed from the Singapore target words. Looking at Cos-RV-sg-sg and Cos-RV-sg-bj, it appears that extracting feature vectors for the Cilin words from the Singapore subcorpus leads to better performance than extracting them from the Beijing subcorpus. It suggests that although the Singapore subcorpus shares those words in Cilin, the context in which they are used might be slightly different from their use in Mainland China. Thus extracting their contextual features from the Singapore subcorpus might better reflect their usage and makes it more comparable with the unique target words from Singapore. Such possible difference in contextual features with shared lexical items between different Chinese speech communities would require further investigation, and will form part of our future work as discussed below.

Taipei data, on the contrary, seems to be more affected by the different testing conditions. Cos-Bin-tw-bj and Cos-RV-tw-bj produced similar results, and both conditions showed better results than Cos-RV-tw-tw. This supports our hypothesis that the effect of data heterogeneity is so apparent that it is much harder to classify target words unique to Taipei with respect to the Cilin categories. In addition, as Kwong and Tsou (2006) observed, Beijing and Taipei data share the least number of lexical items, among the four regions under investigation.

First, we will experiment with the automatic classification at the Cilin semantic head level, which is much more fine-grained than the subclasses. The fine-grainedness might make the task more difficult, but at the same time the more specialized grouping might pose less ambiguity for classification. Second, we will further experiment with classifying words from other special domains like sports, as well as the general domain. Third, we will study the classification in terms of the partof-speech of the target words, and their respective requirements on the kinds of features which give best classification performance.",

The critical issues include whether the existing classificatory structure could accommodate concepts and expressions specific to various Chinese speech communities, and whether the difference in textual sources might pose difficulty in using conventional similarity measures for the automatic classification. Our experiments, using the cosine function to measure similarity and testing with various sources for extracting contextual vectors, suggest that the classification performance might depend on the compatibility between the words in the thesaurus and the sources from which the target words are drawn. Evaluated against human judgement, an accuracy of over 85% was reached in some cases, which were much higher than the baseline and were very encouraging in general. While human judgement is not straightforward and it is difficult to create a Pan-Chinese lexicon manually, combining simple classification methods with the appropriate data sources seems to be a promising approach toward its automatic construction.",
