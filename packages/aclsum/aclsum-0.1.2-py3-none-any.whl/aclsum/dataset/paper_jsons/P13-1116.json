Obviously, this additional annotations could contribute positively to its semantic analysis. In fact, Gerber and Chai (2010) pointed out that implicit arguments can increase the coverage of argument structures in NomBank by 71%. However, current automatic systems require large amounts of manually annotated training data for each predicate. The effort required for this manual annotation explains the absence of generally applicable tools. This problem has become a main concern for many NLP tasks. This fact explains a new trend to develop accurate unsupervised systems that exploit simple but robust linguistic principles (Raghunathan et al., 2010) .",

In particular, we have followed a similar approach to the one proposed by Dahl et al.

We present an extension of this idea assuming that in a coherent document the different ocurrences of a predicate, including both verbal and nominal forms, tend to be mentions of the same event, and thus, they share the same argument fillers. Following this approach, we have developed a deterministic algorithm that obtains competitive results with respect to supervised methods. That is, our system can be applied to any predicate without training data.",

(2010) presented a task in SemEval-2010 that included an implicit argument identification challenge based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) . The corpus for this task consisted in some novel chapters. They covered a wide variety of nominal and verbal predicates, each one having only a small number of instances. Only two systems were presented for this subtask obtaining quite poor results (F1 below 0,02). VENSES++ (Tonelli and Delmonte, 2010) applied a rule based anaphora resolution procedure and semantic similarity between candidates and thematic roles using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) . The system was tuned in (Tonelli and Delmonte, 2011) improving slightly its performance. SEMAFOR (Chen et al., 2010 ) is a supervised system that extended an existing semantic role labeler to enlarge the search window to other sentences, replacing the features defined for regular arguments with two new semantic features. Although this system obtained the best performance in the task, data sparseness strongly affected the results. Besides the two systems presented to the task, some other systems have used the same dataset and evaluation metrics. Ruppenhofer et al. (2011) , Laparra and Rigau (2012) , Gorinski et al. (2013) and Laparra and Rigau (2013) explore alternative linguistic and semantic strategies. These works obtained significant gains over previous approaches. Silberer and Frank (2012) adapted an entity-based coreference resolution model to extend automatically the training corpus. Exploiting this additional data, their system was able to improve previous results. Following this approach Moor et al. (2013) present a corpus of predicate-specific annotations for verbs in the FrameNet paradigm that are aligned with PropBank and VerbNet.",

Unlike the dataset from SemEval-2010 (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010) , in this work the authors focused on a small set of ten predicates. But for those predicates, they annotated a large amount of instances in the documents from the Wall Street Journal that were already annotated for PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank. This allowed them to avoid the sparseness problems and generalize properly from the training set. The results of this system were far better than those obtained by the systems that faced the SemEval-2010 dataset. This works represent the deepest study so far of the features that characterizes the implicit arguments2 . However, many of the most important features are lexically dependent on the predicate and cannot been generalized. Thus, specific annotations are required for each new predicate to be analyzed.",

These predicates are all nominalizations of other verbal predicates, without sense ambiguity, that appear frequently in the corpus and tend to have implicit arguments associated with their instances. These constraints allowed them to model enough occurrences of each implicit argument in order to cover adequately all the possible cases appearing in a test document.

If the arguments of a predicate are explicit, they always replace default fillers previously captured. When there is no antecedent for a particular implicit argument arg n , the algorithm tries to find in the surrounding context which participant is the most likely to be the filler according to some salience factors (see Section 4.2). For the following instances, without an explicit filler for a particular argument position, the algorithm repeats the same selection process and compares the new implicit candidate with the default one. That is, the default implicit argument of a predicate with no antecedent can change every time the algorithm finds a filler with a greater salience.

First, we have designed a list of very general semantic categories. Second, we have semi-automatically assigned one of them to every predicate argument arg n in PropBank and Nom-Bank. For this, we have used the semantic annotation provided by the training documents of the CoNLL-2008 dataset. This annotation was performed automatically using the SuperSense-Tagger (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006) and includes named-entities and WordNet Super-Senses 4 . We have also defined a mapping between the semantic classes provided by the SuperSenseTagger and our seven semantic categories (see Table 1 for more details). Then, we have acquired the most common categories of each predicate argument arg n .
