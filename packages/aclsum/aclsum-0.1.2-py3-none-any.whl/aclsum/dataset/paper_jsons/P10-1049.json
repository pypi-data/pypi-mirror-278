In contrast to heuristic extraction, the proposed method provides a way of consistently training and using phrase models in translation. We use a modified version of a phrase-based decoder to perform the forced alignment. This way we ensure that all models used in training are identical to the ones used at decoding time. An illustration of the basic idea can be seen in Figure 1 . In the literature this method by itself has been shown to be problematic because it suffers from over-fitting (DeNero et al., 2006) , (Liang et al., 2006) . Since our initial phrases are extracted from the same training data, that we want to align, very long phrases can be found for segmentation. As these long phrases tend to occur in only a few training sentences, the EM algorithm generally overestimates their probability and neglects shorter phrases, which better generalize to unseen data and thus are more useful for translation. In order to counteract these effects, our training procedure applies leaving-one-out on the sentence level. Our results show, that this leads to a better translation quality.",

When given a bilingual sentence pair, we can usually assume there are a number of equally correct phrase segmentations and corresponding alignments. For example, it may be possible to transform one valid segmentation into another by splitting some of its phrases into sub-phrases or by shifting phrase boundaries. This is different from word-based translation models, where a typical assumption is that each target word corresponds to only one source word. As a result of this ambiguity, different segmentations are recruited for different examples during training. That in turn leads to over-fitting which shows in overly determinized estimates of the phrase translation probabilities. In addition, (DeNero et al., 2006) found that the trained phrase table shows a highly peaked distribution in opposition to the more flat distribution resulting from heuristic extraction, leaving the decoder only few translation options at decoding time.",

In this section, we describe a leaving-one-out method that can improve the phrase alignment in situations, where the probability of rare phrases and alignments might be overestimated. The training data that consists of N parallel sentence pairs f n and e n for n = 1, . . . , N is used for both the initialization of the translation model p( f |\u1ebd) and the phrase model training. While this way we can make full use of the available data and avoid unknown words during training, it has the drawback that it can lead to overfitting. All phrases extracted from a specific sentence pair f n , e n can be used for the alignment of this sentence pair. This includes longer phrases, which only match in very few sentences in the data. Therefore those long phrases are trained to fit only a few sentence pairs, strongly overestimating their translation probabilities and failing to generalize. In the extreme case, whole sentences will be learned as phrasal translations. The average length of the used phrases is an indicator of this kind of over-fitting, as the number of matching training sentences decreases with increasing phrase length. We can see an example in Figure 2 . Without leaving-one-out the sentence is segmented into a few long phrases, which are unlikely to occur in data to be translated. Phrase boundaries seem to be unintuitive and based on some hidden structures. With leaving-one-out the phrases are shorter and therefore better suited for generalization to unseen data.",

However, (DeNero et al., 2006) experienced similar over-fitting with short phrases due to the fact that the same word sequence can be segmented in different ways, leading to specific segmentations being learned for specific training sentence pairs. Our results confirm these findings. To deal with this problem, instead of simple phrase length restriction, we propose to apply the leavingone-out method, which is also used for language modeling techniques (Kneser and Ney, 1995) .",

Standard leavingone-out assigns a fixed probability \u03b1 to singleton phrase pairs. This way the decoder will prefer using more frequent phrases for the alignment, but is able to resort to singletons if necessary. However, we found that with this method longer singleton phrases are preferred over shorter ones, because fewer of them are needed to produce the target sentence. In order to better generalize to unseen data, we would like to give the preference to shorter phrases. This is done by length-based leavingone-out, where singleton phrases are assigned the probability \u03b2 (| f |+|\u1ebd|) with the source and target In our experiments we set \u03b1 = e -20 and \u03b2 = e -5 .

For the feature-wise combination the two generative phrase probabilities are added to the features, resulting in a total of 10 features.

Table 3 shows translation scores of the count model on the development data after the first training iteration for both leaving-one-out strategies we have introduced and for training without leaving-one-out with different restrictions on phrase length. We can see that by restricting the source phrase length to a maximum of 3 words, the trained model is close to the performance of the heuristic phrase model. With the application of leaving-one-out, the trained model is superior to the baseline, the length-based strategy performing slightly better than standard leaving-one-out.

                "text": "The count model we describe in Section 4.1 estimates phrase translation probabilities using counts from the n-best phrase alignments. For smaller n the resulting phrase table contains fewer phrases and is more deterministic. For higher values of n more competing alignments are taken into account, resulting in a bigger phrase table and a smoother distribution. We can see in Figure 3 that translation performance improves by moving from the Viterbi alignment to n-best alignments. The variations in performance with sizes between n = 10 and n = 10000 are less than 0.2 BLEU. The maximum is reached for n = 100, which we used in all subsequent experiments. An additional benefit of the count model is the smaller phrase table size compared to the heuristic phrase extraction. This is consistent with the findings of (Birch et al., 2006) . The final results are given in Table 5 . We can see that the count model outperforms the baseline by 0.8 BLEU on DEV and 0.9 BLEU on T EST after the first training iteration. The performance of the filtered baseline phrase table shows that part of that improvement derives from the smaller phrase table size. Application of crossvalidation (cv) in the first iteration yields a performance close to training with leaving-one-out (l1o), which indicates that cross-validation can be safely applied to higher training iterations as an alternative to leaving-one-out. The weighted count model clearly under-performs the simpler count model. A second iteration of the training algorithm shows nearly no changes in BLEU score, but a small improvement in TER. Here, we used the phrase table trained with leaving-one-out in the first iteration and applied cross-validation in the second iteration. Log-linear interpolation of the count model with the heuristic yields a further increase, showing an improvement of 1.3 BLEU on DEV and 1.4 BLEU on T EST over the baseline. The interpo-Table 5 : Final results for the heuristic phrase table filtered to contain the same phrases as the count model (baseline filt.), the count model trained with leaving-one-out (l1o) and cross-validation (cv), the weighted count model and the full model. Further, scores for fixed log-linear interpolation of the count model trained with leaving-one-out with the heuristic as well as a feature-wise combination are shown. The results of the second training iteration are given in the bottom row. lation weight is adjusted on the development set and was set to \u03c9 = 0.6. Integrating both models into the log-linear framework (feat. comb.) yields a BLEU score slightly lower than with fixed interpolation on both DEV and T EST . This might be attributed to deficiencies in the tuning procedure. The full model, where we extract all phrases from the search graph, weighted with their posterior probability, performs comparable to the count model with a slightly worse BLEU and a slightly better TER.",

Due to pruning in the forced alignment step, not all translation options are considered. As a result experiments can be done more rapidly and with less resources than with the heuristically extracted phrase table. Also, our experiments show that the increased performance of the count model is partly derived from the smaller phrase table size. In Table 5 we can see that the performance of the heuristic phrase model can be increased by 0.6 BLEU on T EST by filtering the phrase table to contain the same phrases as the count model and reoptimizing the log-linear model weights.
