If, as seems likely, the searcher is seeking pages about the large, mechanically-powered two-man saws used by lumberjacks and sawyers to cut big trees, then the first segmentation is correct. Indeed, a phrasal search for \"two man power saw\" on Google does find the device of interest. So does the second interpretation, but along with other, less-relevant pages discussing competitions involving \"two-man handsaw, two-woman handsaw, power saw log bucking, etc.\" The top document returned for the third interpretation, meanwhile, describes a man on a rampage at a subway station with two cordless power saws, while the fourth interpretation finds pages about topics ranging from hockey's thrilling two-man power play advantage to the man power situation during the Second World War.

In Section 3, we describe our approach and the features we use. Section 4 describes our labelled data, as well as the specific tools used for our experiments.

NC bracketing determines the syntactic structure of an NC as expressed by a binary tree, or, equivalently, a binary bracketing (Nakov and Hearst, 2005a) . Zhai (1997) first identified the importance of syntactic query/corpus parsing for information retrieval, but did not consider query segmentation itself. In principle, as N increases, the number of binary trees for an Ntoken compound is much greater than the 2 N -1 possible segmentations. In practice, empirical NC research has focused on three-word compounds. The computational problem is thus deciding whether the three-word NC has a left or right-bracketing structure (Lauer, 1995) . For the segmentation task, analysing a three-word NC requires deciding between four different segmentations. For example, there are two bracketings for \"used car parts,\" the left-bracketing \"[[used car] parts]\" and the rightbracketing \"[used [car parts]],\" while there are four segmentations, including the case where there is only one segment, \"[used car parts]\" and the base case where each token forms its own segment, \" [used] [car] [parts] .\" Query segmentation thus naturally handles the case where the query consists of multiple, separate noun phrases that should not be analysed with a single binary tree.",

These are collocations in the linguistics sense (Manning and Sch\u00fctze, 1999, pages 183-187) ; we cannot substitute related words for terms in these expressions nor apply syntactic transformations or paraphrases (e.g. we don't say \"investigator of privates\"). However, for a query such as \"bank manager,\" should we exclude web pages that discuss \"manager of the bank\" or \"branch manager for XYZ bank\"? If a user is searching for a particular webpage, excluding such results could be harmful. However, for query substitution or expansion, identifying that \"bank manager\" is a single unit may be useful. We can resolve the conflicting objectives of our two motivating applications by moving to a multi-layer query bracketing scheme, first segmenting unbreakable collocations and then building them into semantic units with a query segmentation grammar.

Our comparison system is the MI approach used by Jones et al. (2006) , which achieves 68% Seg-Acc and 26.6% Qry-Acc (Table 3 ). We let the SVM set the threshold for MI on the training set. Note that the Basic, Decision-Boundary system (Section 3.2.1), which uses exactly the same cooccurrence information as the MI system (in the form of the Basic features) but allows the SVM to discriminatively weight the logarithmic counts, immediately increases Seg-Acc performance by 3.7%. Even more strikingly, adding the Basic count information for the Context tokens (Section 3.2.2) boosts performance by another 8.5%, increasing Qry-Acc by over 22%.

Indeed, results are lower if we evaluate using the test-set labels from another annotator (necessarily training on the original annotator's labels). On the intersected set of the three annotators, however, results are better still: 88.7% Seg-Acc and 69.4% Qry-Acc on the intersected queries for the full-featured system (Table 3 ).

As there is growing interest in making maximal use of annotation resources within discriminative learning techniques (Zaidan et al., 2007) , developing a general empirical approach to learning from ambiguously-labelled examples would be both an important contribution to this trend and a potentially helpful technique in a number of NLP domains.",

Exactly such an evaluation was recently used by Kumaran and Allan (2007) for the related task of query contraction. Of course, a dataset with queries and retrieval scores may serve for more than evaluation; it may provide the examples used by the learning module. That is, the parameters of the contraction or segmentation scoring function could be discriminatively set to optimize the retrieval of the training set queries. A unified framework for query contraction, segmentation, and expansion, all based on discriminatively optimizing retrieval performance, is a very appealing future research direction. In this framework, the size of the training sets would not be limited by human annotation resources, but by the number of queries for which retrieved-document relevance judgments are available. Generating more training examples would allow the use of more powerful, finer-grained lexical features for classification.",
