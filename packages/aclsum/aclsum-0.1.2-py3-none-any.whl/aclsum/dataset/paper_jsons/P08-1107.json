Large collections offer greater scope for assembling evidence to help with that task, but they pose additional challenges as well. With well over 100,000 unique email addresses in the CMU version of the Enron collection (Klimt and Yang, 2004) , common names (e.g., John) might easily refer to any one of several hundred people. In this paper, we associate named mentions in unstructured text (i.e., the body of an email and/or the subject line) to modeled identities. We see at least two direct applications for this work: (1) helping searchers who are unfamiliar with the contents of an email collection (e.g., historians or lawyers) better understand the context of emails that they find, and (2) augmenting more typical social networks (based on senders and recipients) with additional links based on references found in unstructured text.",

For the work reported in this paper, we rely on the user to designate references requiring resolution (which we model as a predetermined set of mention-queries for which the correct referent is known). Candidate identification is a computational expedient that permits the evidence assembly effort to be efficiently focused; we use only simple techniques for that task. Our principal contributions are the approaches we take to evidence generation (leveraging three ways of linking to other emails where evidence might be found: reply chains, social interaction, and topical similarity) and our approach to choosing among candidates (based on a generative model of reference production). We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on four collections, three of which have previously reported results for comparison, and one that is considerably larger than the others.",

The steps of this scenario impose a certain structure to our solution. First, we need to have a representational model for each candidate identity. Second, we need to reconstruct the context of the queried mention. Third, it requires a computational model of identity that supports reasoning about identities. Finally, it requires a resolution technique that leverages both the identity models and the context to rank the potential candidates. In this section, we will present our resolution approach within that structure. We first discuss how to build both representational and computational models of identity in section 3.1. Next, we introduce a definition of the contextual space and how we can reconstruct it in section 3.2. Finally, we link those pieces together by the resolution algorithm in section 3.3.",

                "text": "Representation: In a collection of emails, individuals often use different email addresses, multiple forms of their proper names, and different nicknames. In order to track references to a person over a large collection, we need to capture as many as possible of these referential attributes in one representation. We extend our simple representation of identity proposed in (Elsayed and Oard, 2006) where an identity is represented by a set of pairwise co-occurrence of referential attributes (i.e., cooccurrence \"associations\"), and each extracted association has a frequency of occurrence. The attributes are extracted from the headers and salutation and signature lines. For example, an \"addressnickname\" association < a, n > is inferred whenever a nickname n is usually observed in signature lines of emails sent from email address a. Three types of referential attributes were identified in the original representation: email addresses, names, and nicknames. We add usernames as well to account for the absence of any other type of names. Names, nicknames, and usernames are distinguishable based on where each is extracted: email addresses and names from headers, nicknames from salutation and signature lines, and usernames from email addresses. Since (except in rare cases) an email address is bound to one personal identity, the model leverages email addresses as the basis by mandating that at least one email address must appear in any observed association. As an off-line preprocessing step, we extract the referential attributes from the whole collection and build the identity models. The first step in the resolution process is to determine the list of identity models that are viable candidates as the true referent. For the experiments reported in this paper, any identity model with a first name or nickname that exactly matches the mention is considered a candidate. Labeling Observed Names: For the purpose of resolving name mentions, it is necessary to compute the probability p(l|c) that a person c is referred to by a given \"literal\" mention l. Intuitively, that probability can be estimated based on the observed \"nametype\" of l and how often that association occurs in the represented model. We define T as the set of 3 different types of single-token name-types: first, last, and nickname. We did not handle middle names and initials, just for simplicity. Names that are extracted from salutation and signature lines are labeled as nicknames whereas full names extracted from headers are first normalized to \"First Last\" form and then each single token is labeled based on its relative position as being the first or last name. Usernames are treated similarly to full names if they have more than one token, otherwise they are ignored. Note that the same single-token name may appear as a first name and a nickname. Reasoning: Having tokenized and labeled all names, we propose to model the association of a single-token name l of type t to an identity c by a simple 3-node Bayesian network illustrated in Figure 1. In the network, the observed mention l is distributed conditionally on both the identity c and the name-type t. p(c) is the prior probability of observing the identity c in the collection. p(t|c) is the probability that a name-type t is used to refer to c. p(l|t, c) is the probability of referring to c by l of type t. These probabilities can be inferred from the representational model as follows:",

Conversational Context: Threads (i.e., reply chains) are imperfect approximations of focused discussions, since people sometimes switch topics within a thread (and indeed sometimes within the same email). We nonetheless expect threads to exhibit a useful degree of focus and we have therefore adopted them as a computational representation of a discussion in our experiments. To reconstruct threads in the collection, we adopted the technique introduced in (Lewis and Knowles, 1997) . Thread reconstruction results in a unique tree containing the mention-email. Although we can distinguish between different paths or subtrees of that tree, we elected to have a uniform distribution over all emails in the same thread. This also applies to threads retrieved in the social and topical contexts as well. Social Context: Discussions that share common participants may also be useful, though we expect their utility to decay somewhat with time. To reconstruct that context, we temporally rank emails that share at least one participant with e m in a time period around e m and then expand each by its thread (with duplicate removal). Emails in each thread are then each assigned a weight that equals the reciprocal of its thread rank. We do that separately for emails that temporally precede or follow e m . Finally, weights are normalized to produce one distribution for the whole social context. Topical Context: Identifying topically-similar content is a traditional query-by-example problem that has been well researched in, for example, the TREC routing task (Lewis, 1996) and the Topic Detection and Tracking evaluations (Allan, 2002) . Individual emails may be quite terse, but we can exploit the conversational structure to obtain topically related text. In our experiments, we tracked back to the root of the thread in which e m was found and used the subject line and the body text of that root email as a query to Lucene3 to identify topically-similar emails. Terms found in the subject line are doubled in the query to emphasize what is sometimes a concise description of the original topic. Subsequent processing is then similar to that used for the social context, except that the emails are first ranked by their topical, rather than temporal, similarity.",

Our approach outperforms previously reported techniques and it scales well to larger collections. Moreover, our results serve to highlight the importance of social context when resolving mentions in social media, which is an idea that deserves more attention generally. In future work, we plan to extend our test collection with mention queries that must be resolved in the \"long tail\" of the identity distribution where less evidence is available. We are also interested in exploring iterative approaches to jointly resolving mentions.",
