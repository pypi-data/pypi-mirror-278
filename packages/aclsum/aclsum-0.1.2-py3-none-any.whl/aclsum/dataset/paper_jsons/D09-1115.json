We take a real example from the output of the two systems (in Table 3 ) to show that higher BLEU scores correspond to better alignments and better translations. The translation of System C is selected as the backbone. From Table 3 , we can see that because of 1-to-1 mappings, \"Russia\" is aligned to \"Russian\" and \"'s\" to \"null\" in the IHMM-based model, which leads to the error translation \"Russian 's\". Instead, \"Russia 's\" is together aligned to \"Russian\" in the lattice-based model. Also due to 1-to-1 mappings, null word aligned to \"is\" is inserted. As a result, \"is\" is missed in the output of IHMMbased model. In contrast, in the lattice-based system, \"is working with\" are aligned to \"is combined with\", forming a phrase pair.",

As the corpus size was up to 2500K, the BLEU scores both on the dev and test sets declined. The reason is that, on one hand, there are more noise on the 2500K sentence pairs; on the other hand, the 289K sentence pairs cover most of the words appearing on the test set.
