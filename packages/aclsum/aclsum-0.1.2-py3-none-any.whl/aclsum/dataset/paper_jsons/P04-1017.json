Most learning-based pronoun resolution systems determine the reference relationship between an anaphor and its antecedent candidate only from the properties of the pair. The knowledge about the context of anaphor and antecedent is nevertheless ignored. However, research in centering theory (Sidner, 1981; Grosz et al., 1983; Grosz et al., 1995; Tetreault, 2001) has revealed that the local focusing (or centering) also has a great effect on the processing of pronominal expressions. The choices of the antecedents of pronouns usually depend on the center of attention throughout the local discourse segment (Mitkov, 1999) .",

In the algorithms based on the centering theory (Brennan et al., 1987; Grosz et al., 1995) , if a candidate and its antecedent are the backwardlooking centers of two subsequent utterances respectively, the candidate would be the most preferred since the CONTINUE transition is always ranked higher than SHIFT or RETAIN.",

In the study, we start our exploration on the capability of the model by applying it in an ideal environment where the antecedents of the candidates are correctly identified and the backward features are optimally set. The experiments on MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) corpora show that incorporating coreferential information of candidates boosts the system performance significantly. Further, we apply our model in the real resolution where the antecedents of the candidates are provided by separate noun phrase resolution modules. The experimental results show that our model still outperforms the baseline, even with the low recall of the non-pronoun resolution module.",

The feature candi NoAntecedent marks whether or not a candidate has a valid antecedent in the preceding text.

Since DT pron produces more correct feature values than DT pron , we could expect that DT pron will not be worse, if not better, than DT pron . Such a process could be repeated to refine the pronoun resolution classifier. The algorithm is described in Figure 3 .In algorithm REFINE-CLASSIFIER, the iteration terminates when the new trained classifier DT i+1 pron provides no further improvement than DT i pron . In this case, we can replace DT i+1 pron by DT i pron during the i+1(th) testing procedure. That means, by simply running PRON-RESOLVE(DT non-pron ,DT i pron ), we can use for both backward feature computation and instance classification tasks, rather than applying DT pron and DT pron subsequently.",
