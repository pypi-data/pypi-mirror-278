Instead, researchers routinely use automatic metrics like Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) as the sole evidence of improvement to translation quality. Automatic metrics have been criticized for a variety of reasons (Babych and Hartley, 2004; Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Chiang et al., 2008) , and it is clear that they only loosely approximate human judgments.

These tasks included word sense disambiguation, word similarity, textual entailment, and temporal ordering of events, but not machine translation. Snow et al. measured the quality of non-expert annotations by comparing them against labels that had been previously created by expert annotators. They report inter-annotator agreement between expert and non-expert annotators, and show that the average of many non-experts converges on performance of a single expert for many of their tasks. Although it is not common for manual evaluation results to be reported in conference papers, several large-scale manual evaluations of machine translation quality take place annually. These include public forums like the NIST MT Evaluation Workshop, IWSLT and WMT, as well as the project-specific Go/No Go evaluations for the DARPA GALE program. Various types of human judgments are used. NIST collects 5-point fluency and adequacy scores (LDC, 2005) , IWSLT and WMT collect relative rankings (Callison-Burch et al., 2008; Paul, 2006) , and DARPA evaluates using HTER (Snover et al., 2006) . The details of these are provided later in the paper. Public evaluation campaigns provide a ready source of goldstandard data that non-expert annotations can be compared to.",
