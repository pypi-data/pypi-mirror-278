In this paper, we propose the first approach for applying distant supervision to crosssentence relation extraction. At the core of our approach is a graph representation that can incorporate both standard dependencies and discourse relations, thus providing a unifying way to model relations within and across sentences. We extract features from multiple paths in this graph, increasing accuracy and robustness when confronted with linguistic variation and analysis error. Experiments on an important extraction task for precision medicine show that our approach can learn an accurate cross-sentence extractor, using only a small existing knowledge base and unlabeled text from biomedical research articles.

The ensuing information overload creates new urgency in assimilating frag-mented knowledge for integration and reasoning. A salient case in point is precision medicine (Bahcall, 2015) . The cost of sequencing a person's genome has fallen below $10001 , enabling individualized diagnosis and treatment of complex genetic diseases such as cancer. The availability of measurement for 20,000 human genes makes it imperative to integrate all knowledge about them, which grows rapidly and is scattered in millions of articles in PubMed2 . Traditional extraction approaches require annotated examples, which makes it difficult to scale to the explosion of extraction demands. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in indirect supervision (Banko et al., 2007; Poon and Domingos, 2009; Toutanova et al., 2015) , with distant supervision (Craven et al., 1998; Mintz et al., 2009) emerging as a particularly promising paradigm for augmenting existing knowledge bases from unlabeled text (Poon et al., 2015; Parikh et al., 2015) .",

Consider the following example:\"The p56Lck inhibitor Dasatinib was shown to enhance apoptosis induction by dexamethasone in otherwise GC-resistant CLL cells. This finding concurs with the observation by Sade showing that Notch-mediated resistance of a mouse lymphoma cell line could be overcome by inhibiting p56Lck.\" Together, the two sentences convey the fact that the drug Dasatinib could overcome resistance conferred by mutations to the Notch gene, which can not be inferred from either sentence alone. The impact of missed opportunities is especially pronounced in the long tail of knowledge. Such information is crucial for integrative reasoning as it includes the newest findings in specialized domains.",

The key idea is to adopt a document-level graph representation that augments conventional intra-sentential dependencies with new dependencies introduced for adjacent sentences and discourse relations. It provides a unifying way to derive features for classifying relations between entity pairs. As we augment this graph with new arcs, the number of possible paths between entities grow. We demonstrate that feature extraction along multiple paths leads to more robust extraction, allowing the learner to find structural patterns even when the language varies or the parser makes an error.",

However, the differences are substantial. First and foremost, their approach used standard supervised learning rather than distant supervision. Moreover, we introduced the document-level graph representation, which is much more general, capable of incorporating a diverse set of discourse relations and enabling the use of rich syntactic and surface features (Section 3). Finally, Swampillai & Stevenson (2011) evaluated on MUC64 , which contains only 318 Wall Street Journal articles. In contrast, we evaluated on large-scale extraction from about one million full-text articles and demonstrated the large impact of cross-sentence extraction for an important real-world application.",

Prior extraction work focuses on newswire text5 and the Web (Craven et al., 2000) . In these domains, the extracted relations often involve popular entities, for which there often exist single sentences expressing the relation (Banko et al., 2007) . However, there is much less redundancy in specialized domains such as the frontiers of science and technology, where crosssentence extraction is more likely to have a significant impact. The long-tailed characteristics of such domains also make distant supervision a natural choice for scaling up learning. This paper represents a first step toward exploring the confluence of these two directions.",

Linear and dependency paths are popular features for relation extraction (Snow et al., 2006; Mintz et al., 2009) .

In contrast, we allow interleaving edges from dependency and word adjacency, and consider top K paths rather than just the shortest one. This resulted in substantial accuracy gain (Section 4.5).",

Notably, while Koch et al. (2014) and Augenstein et al.

We explored the potential of this approach in our experiments, but found that it had little impact in our domain, as it produced few additional candidates beyond single sentences. Recently, discourse parsing has received renewed interest (Ji and Eisenstein, 2014; Feng and Hirst, 2014; Surdeanu et al., 2015) , and discourse information has been shown to improve performance in applications such as question answering (Sharp et al., 2015) .

We found the shortest path between any word in the first span and any word in the second span using only dependency and adjacent sentence edges, and added an edge labeled with the discourse relation between these two words. Another source of potentially cross-sentence links comes from coreference.

We set the weight for adjacent-word edges to 16, to give higher priority to other edge types (weight 1) that are arguably more semantics-related.

Table 3 shows the results. Penalizing adjacency produces large gains; a harsh penalty is particularly helpful with fewer paths. These results support the hypothesis that dependency edges are usually more meaningful for relation extraction than word adjacency. Therefore, if adjacency edges get the same weights, they might cause some dependency sub-paths drop out of the top K paths, thus degrading performance. When the path number increases, there is a consistent and substantial increase in accuracy, which demonstrates the advantage of allowing adjacency edges to interleave with dependency ones. This presumably helps address syntactic parsing errors, among other things. The importance of adjacency weights decreases with more paths, but it is still significantly better to penalize adjacency edges.",
