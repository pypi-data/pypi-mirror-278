    "abstract": "This paper presents an study of the use of interlocking phrases in phrase-based statistical machine translation. We examine the effect on translation quality when the translation units used in the translation hypotheses are allowed to overlap on the source side, on the target side and on both sides. A large-scale evaluation on 380 language pairs was conducted. Our results show that overall the use of overlapping phrases improved translation quality by 0.3 BLEU points on average. Further analysis revealed that language pairs requiring a larger amount of re-ordering benefited the most from our approach. When the evaluation was restricted to such pairs, the average improvement increased to up to 0.75 BLEU points with over 97% of the pairs improving. Our approach requires only a simple modification to the decoding algorithm and we believe it should be generally applicable to improve the performance of phrase-based decoders.",

They used the CDEC SMT decoder (Dyer et al., 2010) that offers several learners for discriminative tuning of weights for the new phrases. Their results showed improvements of 0.3 to 0.6 BLEU points over discriminatively trained hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems on two datasets for German-to-English translation. (Tribble and et al., 2003) proposed a method to generate longer new phrases by merging existing phraselevel alignments that have overlaping words on both source and target sides. Their experiments on translating Arabic-English text from the news domain were encouraging. (Roth and McCallum, 2010) proposed a conditional-random-field approach to discriminatively train phrase based machine translation in which training and decoding are both cast in a sampling framework. Different with traditional PB-SMT decoding that infers both a Viterbi alignment and the target sentence, their approach produced a rich overlapping phrase alignment. Their approach leveraged arbitrary features of the entire source sentence, target sentence and alignment. (K\u00e4\u00e4ri\u00e4inen, 2009) proposed a novel phrase-based conditional exponential family translation model for SMT. The model operates on a feature representation in which sentence level translations are represented by enumerating all the known phrase level translations that occur inside them. The model automatically takes into account information provided by phrase overlaps. Although both of the latter two approaches were innovative the translation performance was lower than tranditional PBSMT baselines.",

An interlock of length k is can occur if the last k tokens of the partial translation match the first k tokens of the target side of the translation unit being used to extend the hypothesis. In this case the decoder may create an extended hypothesis with the target side of the translation unit interlocked with the target word sequence generated so far. In order to do this, the k interlocked words are not inserted a second time into the target token sequence and the word penalty (if pre-calculated) is adjusted to reflect this. In the example given in Figure 1 , the translation resulting from extending the search with the interlocking translation unit will be t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 .",

In Figure 2 (A), a source phrase is interlocking with source words to the left; in (B) a source phrase is interlocking with source words to the right; and in (C) a source phrase is interlocking on both sides. The interlocking process is handled before the search process begins, at the time the set of translation options used in the search is created. Additional interlocking translation options are created in which the source side phrase is permitted to overlap with the surrounding source context, however, later during the search this translation unit will only be used to translate (cover) the sequence of non-interlocking words. In this way, the decoder's search algorithm can be used without modification, when dealing with interlocking source phrases.",

The results on the Europarl corpus are shown in Table 2 . For three of the language pairs we observed increases in BLEU scores over the baseline for all interlocking methods with substantial gains of 1.9 to 2.6 BLEU points coming from the source interlocking technique.

In the proposed method phrases are allowed to interlock freely on both the source and target side during decoding. The experimental results, based on a large-scale study involving 380 language pairs provide strong evidence that our approach is genuinely effective in improving the machine translation quality. The translation quality improved for 77% of the language pairs tested, and this was increased to over 97% when the set of language pairs was filtered according to Kendall's tau distance. The translation quality improved by an average of up to 0.75 BLEU points on this subset. This value represents a lower bound on what is possible with this technique and in future work we intend to study the introduction of additional features into the log-linear model to encourage or discourage the use of interlocking phrases during decoding, and investigate the effect of increasing the number of interlocked words.",
