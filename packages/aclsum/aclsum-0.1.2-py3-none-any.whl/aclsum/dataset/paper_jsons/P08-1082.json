Thanks to international evaluations organized by conferences such as the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)1 or the Cross Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) Workshop2 , annotated corpora of questions and answers have become available for several languages, which has facilitated the development of robust machine learning models for the task.",

Comparatively little research has focused on QA models for non-factoid questions such as causation, manner, or reason questions. Because virtually no training data is available for this problem, most automated systems train either on small hand-annotated corpora built in house (Higashinaka and Isozaki, 2008) or on question-answer pairs harvested from Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists or similar resources (Soricut and Brill, 2006) . None of these situations is ideal: the cost of building the training corpus in the former setup is high; in the latter scenario the data tends to be domain-specific, hence unsuitable for the learning of open-domain models.",

Of particular interest in our context are communitydriven question-answering sites, such as Yahoo! Answers 3 , where users answer questions posed by other users and best answers are selected manually either by the asker or by all the participants in the thread. The data generated by these sites has significant advantages over other web resources: (a) it has a high growth rate and it is already abundant; (b) it covers a large number of topics, hence it offers a better approximation of open-domain content; and (c) it is available for many languages. Community QA sites, similar to FAQs, provide large number of questionanswer pairs. Nevertheless, this data has a significant drawback: it has high variance of quality, i.e., answers range from very informative to completely irrelevant or even abusive.

This is not the focus of our work: here we investigate the problem of learning an answer ranking model capable of dealing with complex questions, using a large number of, possible noisy, question-answer pairs. By focusing exclusively on textual content we increase the portability of our approach to other collections where \"social\" features might not available, e.g., Web search. The paper is organized as follows. We describe our approach, including all the features explored for answer modeling, in Section 2. We introduce the corpus used in our empirical analysis in Section 3. We detail our experiments and analyze the results in Section 4. We overview related work in Section 5 and conclude the paper in Section 6. ",

The retrieval component uses a state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) model to extract A given Q. Since our focus is on exploring the usability of the answer content, we do not perform retrieval by finding similar questions already answered (Jeon et al., 2005) , i.e., our answer collection C contains only the site's answers without the corresponding questions answered.",

The scoring function is a linear combination of four different classes of features (detailed in Section 2.2). This function is the focus of the paper. To answer our first research objective we will compare the quality of the rankings provided by this component against the rankings generated by the IR model used for answer retrieval. To answer the second research objective we will analyze the contribution of the proposed feature set to this function. Again, since our interest is in investigating the utility of the answer textual content, we use only information extracted from the answer text when learning the scoring function.

Wherever applicable, we explore different syntactic and semantic representations of the textual content, e.g., extracting the dependency-based representation of the text or generalizing words to their WordNet supersenses (WNSS) (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006) .

Sentences were annotated with WNSS categories, using the tagger of Ciaramita and Altun (2006) 9 , which annotates text with a 46-label tagset. These tags, defined by Word-Net lexicographers, provide a broad semantic categorization for nouns and verbs and include labels for nouns such as food, animal, body and feeling, and for verbs labels such as communication, contact, and possession. Next, we parsed all sentences with the dependency parser of Attardi et al. (2007) 10 .

The algorithm incrementally adds to the feature set the feature that provides the highest MRR improvement in the development partition. The process stops when no features yield any improvement. The table shows that, while the features selected span all the four feature groups introduced, the lion's share is taken by the translation features: approximately 60% of the MRR improvement is achieved by these features.

On the other hand, some features do not provide a useful signal at all. A notable example in this class is the web-based CCP feature, which was designed originally for factoid answer validation and does not adapt well to our problem. Because the length of non-factoid answers is typically significantly larger than in the factoid QA task, we have to discard a large part of the query when computing hits(Q+A) to reach non-zero counts.

This indicates that, in terms of individual contributions, our NLP processors can be approximated with simpler n-gram models in this task. Hence, is it fair to say that syntactic and semantic analysis is useful for such Web QA tasks? While the above analysis seems to suggest a negative answer, the right-hand side of Table 4 tells a more interesting story. It shows that the NLP analysis provides complementary information to the ngram-based models. The best models for the FG2 and FG3 feature groups are obtained when combining the n-gram representations with the representations that use the output of the NLP processors (W + B + B g + D). The improvements are relatively small, but remarkable (e.g., see FG2) if we take into account the significant scale of the evaluation. This observation correlates well with the analysis shown in Table 3 , which shows that features using semantic (B g ) and syntactic (D) representations contribute the most on top of the IR model (BM25(W)).",

This provides an excellent framework for large-scale experimentation with various models that otherwise might be hard to understand or evaluate.

For example, on the Web our ranking system could be combined with a passage retrieval system to form a QA system for complex questions.
