One of the reason for this attention, we believe, is that being able to extract social networks from unstructured text may provide a powerful new tool for historians, political scientists, scholars of literature, and journalists to analyze large collections of texts around entities and their interactions. The tool would allow researchers to quickly extract networks and assess their size, nature, and cohesiveness, a task that would otherwise be impossible with corpora numbering millions of documents. It would also make it possible to make falsifiable claims about these networks, bringing the experimental method to disciplines like history, where it is still relatively rare.",

For example, in the following sentence, we would add two links to the network: a one-directional link between Toujan Faisal and the committee, triggered by the word said (because Toujan is talking about the committee) and a bi-directional link between the same entities triggered by the word informed (a mutual interaction).",

Our results show that hand-crafted frame semantic features, which are linguistically motivated, add less value to the overall performance in comparison with the frame-semantic tree kernels. We believe this is due to the fact that hand-crafted features require frame parses to be highly accurate and complete. In contrast, tree kernels are able to find and leverage less strict patterns without requiring the semantic parse to be entirely accurate or complete.",

For feature vectors, we use a linear kernel, i.e. K(x i , x j ) = x i \u2022 x j (dot product of the two vectors). For our tree representations, we use a Partial Tree Kernel (PTK), first proposed by Moschitti (2006) . PTK is a relaxed version of the Subset Tree (SST) kernel proposed by Collins and Duffy (2002) . A subset tree kernel measures the similarity between two trees by counting all subtrees common to the two trees. However, there is one constraint: all daughter nodes of a parent node must be included (in the sub-trees). In PTK, this constraint is removed. Therefore, in contrast to SST, PT kernels compare many more substructures. For a combination of feature vectors and tree representations, we simply use the linear combination of their respective kernels.",

However, a combination of lexical, syntactic and semantic structures improves the performance by an absolute of 1.1% in F1-measure for SED (from 0.574 to 0.585). This gain is statistically significant. For SEC, the absolute gain from our best baseline (BOW_AR2010) is 0.8% in F1-measure (from 82.3 to 83.1), which is not statistically significant. However, the gain of 2% from our previously proposed best system (AR2010) is statistically significant. mantic parses. For example, Rule (4) correctly detects the social event in sentence (5), since Semafor correctly parses the input. In contrast, Semafor does not correctly parse the input sentence (1): it correctly identifies the Statement frame and its Message frame element, but it fails to find the Speaker. As a result, Rule (3) does not fire, even though the semantic structure is partially identified.

Therefore, the task of relation extraction is most closely related to the tasks addressed in this paper. Researchers have used other notions of semantics in the literature such as latent semantic analysis (Plank and Moschitti, 2013) and relation-specific semantics (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) . To the best of our knowledge, there is only one work that uses frame semantics for relation extraction (Harabagiu et al., 2005) . Harabagiu et al. (2005) propose a novel semantic kernel that incorporates frame parse information in the kernel computation that calculates similarity between two dependency trees. They, however, do not propose data representations that are based on frame parses and the resulting arborescent structures, instead adding features to syntactic trees. We believe the implicit feature space of kernels based on our data representation encode a richer and larger feature space than the one proposed by Harabagiu et al. (2005) .",

The performance for our best reported model (AR2010_FrameTreeProp) for OVA in terms precision, recall, and F1-measure is 0.375, 0.592, 0.459 respectively.

Table 4 presents the results for this study. We see that the hand-crafted RULES do not help in the overall task. We investigated the reason for RULES not being as helpful as we had expected. We found that when there is no social event, the rules fire in 7% of the cases. When there is a social event, they fire in 17% of cases. So while they fire more often when there is a social event, the percentage of cases in which they fire is small. We hypothesize that this is due the dependence of RULES on the correctness of se-",

Here the first target and second target are defined in terms of the surface order of words. Though these features have been previously proposed for relation extraction on ACE (GuoDong et al., 2005), they have not been utilized for the task we address in this paper.",
