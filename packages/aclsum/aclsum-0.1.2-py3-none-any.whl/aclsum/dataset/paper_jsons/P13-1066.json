    "abstract": "Online discussion forums are a popular platform for people to voice their opinions on any subject matter and to discuss or debate any issue of interest. In forums where users discuss social, political, or religious issues, there are often heated debates among users or participants. Existing research has studied mining of user stances or camps on certain issues, opposing perspectives, and contention points. In this paper, we focus on identifying the nature of interactions among user pairs. The central questions are: How does each pair of users interact with each other? Does the pair of users mostly agree or disagree? What is the lexicon that people often use to express agreement and disagreement? We present a topic model based approach to answer these questions. Since agreement and disagreement expressions are usually multiword phrases, we propose to employ a ranking method to identify highly relevant phrases prior to topic modeling. After modeling, we use the modeling results to classify the nature of interaction of each user pair. Our evaluation results using real-life discussion/debate posts demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.",

They are usually emitted during interactive exchanges of arguments in ideological discussions. This idea prompted us to introduce the concept of ADsentiment. We define the polarity of agreement expressions as positive and the polarity of disagreement expressions as negative. We refer agreement and disagreement expressions as ADsentiment expressions, or AD-expressions for short. AD-expressions are crucial for the analysis of interactive discussions and debates just as sentiment expressions are instrumental in sentiment analysis (Liu, 2012) . We thus regard this work as an extension to traditional sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012) .",

In this paper, we further improve the work by coupling an information retrieval method to rank good candidate phrases with topic modeling in order to discover more accurate ADexpressions. Furthermore, we apply the resulting AD-expressions to the new task of classifying the arguing or interaction nature of each pair of users. Using discovered AD-expressions for classification has an important advantage over traditional classification because they are domain independent. We employ a semi-supervised generative model called JTE-P to jointly model AD-expressions, pair interactions, and discussion topics simultaneously in a single framework. With such complex interactions mined, we can produce many useful summaries of discussions. For example, we can discover the most contentious pairs for each topic and ideological camps of participants, i.e., people who often agree with each other are likely to belong to the same camp. The proposed framework also facilitates tracking users' ideology shifts and the resulting arguing nature.",

As discussed earlier, agreement and disagreement are a special form of sentiments and are different from the sentiment studied in the mainstream research. Traditional sentiment is mainly expressed with sentiment terms (e.g., great and bad), while agreement and disagreement are inferred by AD-expressions (e.g., I agree and I disagree), which we also call AD-sentiment expressions.

There have been various extensions to multi-grain (Titov and McDonald, 2008) , labeled (Ramage et al., 2009) , and sequential (Du et al., 2010) topic models. Yet other approaches extend topic models to produce author specific topics (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004) , author persona (Mimno and McCallum, 2007) , social roles (McCallum et al., 2007) , etc. However, these models do not model debates and hence are unable to discover AD-expressions and interaction natures of author pairs. Also related are topic models in sentiment analysis which are often referred to as Aspect and Sentiment models (ASMs). ASMs come in two main flavors: Type-1 ASMs discover aspect (or topic) words sentiment-wise (i.e., discovering positive and negative topic words and sentiments for each topic without separating topic and sentiment terms) (e.g., Lin and He, 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010, Jo and Oh, 2011) . Type-2 ASMs separately discover both aspects and sentiments (e.g., Mei et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2010) . Recently, domain knowledge induced ASMs have also been proposed (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012b; Chen et al., 2013) . The generative process of ASMs is, however, different from our model. Specifically, Type-1 ASMs use asymmetric hyper-parameters for aspects while Type-2 assumes that sentiments and aspects are emitted in the same sentence. However, ADexpressions are emitted differently. They are mostly interleaved with users' topical viewpoints and span different sentences. Further, we capture the key characteristic of discussions by encoding pair-wise user interactions. Existing models do not model pair interactions.",

Mukherjee and Liu (2012d) mined comment expressions. These works, however, don't model pair interactions in debates. Support/oppose camp classification: Several works have attempted to put debate authors into support/oppose camps. Agrawal et al. (2003) used a graph based method. Murakami and Raymond (2010) used a rule-based method. In (Galley et al., 2004; Hillard et al., 2003) , speaker utterances were classified into agreement, disagreement and backchannel classes. Stances in online debates: Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009) , Thomas et al. (2006) , Bansal et al. (2008) , Burfoot et al. (2011), and Anand et al. (2011) proposed methods to recognize stances in online debates. Some other research directions include subgroup detection (Abu-Jbara et al., 2012) , tolerance analysis (Mukherjee et al., 2013) , mining opposing perspectives (Lin and Hauptmann, 2006) , linguistic accommodation (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012c) , and contention point mining (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a) . For this work, we adopt the JTE-P model in (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012a) , and make two major advances. We propose a new method to improve the AD-expression mining and a new task of classifying pair interaction nature to determine whether each pair of users who have interacted based on replying relations mostly agree or disagree with each other.",

In our crawled dataset, 77% of all posts exhibit explicit quoting/reply-to relations excluding the first posts of threads which start the discussions and usually have nobody to quote/reply-to. Such author-target exchanges usually go back and forth between pairs of users populating a thread of discussion.

More precisely, the pair specific topic and AD-expression distributions ( \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc47 ; \ud835\udf03 \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc38 ) \"shape\" the topics and AD-expressions emitted in \ud835\udc51 as agreement and disagreement on topical viewpoints are directed towards certain target authors. Each topic (\ud835\udf11 \ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc47 ) and AD-expression type (\ud835\udf11 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc38 ) is characterized by a multinomial distribution over terms (words/phrases). Assume we have \ud835\udc61 = 1 \u2026 \ud835\udc47 topics and \ud835\udc52 = 1 \u2026 \ud835\udc38 expression types in our corpus. Note that in our case of discussion/debate forums, we hypothesize \ud835\udc38 = 2 as in debates, we mostly find two expression types: agreement and disagreement (more details in \u00a76.1). Like most generative models for text, a post (document) is viewed as a bag of n-grams and each n-gram (word/phrase) takes one value from a predefined vocabulary. In this work, we use up to 4-grams, i.e., n = 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead of using all n-grams, a relevance based ranking method is proposed to select a subset of highly relevant n-grams for model building (details in \u00a74). For notational convenience, we use terms to denote both words (unigrams) and phrases (n-grams).",

To perform the switch we use a maximum entropy (Max-Ent) model. The idea is motivated by the observation that topical and AD-expression terms usually play different roles in a sentence. Topical terms (e.g., \"elections\" and \"income tax\") tend to be noun and noun phrases while AD-expression terms (\"I refute\", \"how can you say\", and \"probably agree\") usually contain pronouns, verbs, wh-determiners, and modals. In order to utilize the part-of-speech (POS) tag information, we place the topic/AD-expression distribution \ud835\udf13 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 (the prior over the indicator variable \ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 ) in the term plate (see Figure 1 ) and set it from a Max-Ent model conditioned on the observed feature context \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 associated with \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 and the learned Max-Ent parameters, \ud835\udf06 (details in \u00a76.1). In this work, we use both lexical and POS features of the previous, current, and next POS tags/lexemes of the term \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 as the contextual information, i.e., \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 = [\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57-1 , \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 , \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57+1 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57-1 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 , \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57+1 ], which is used to produce the feature functions for Max-Ent. For phrasal terms (n-grams), all POS tags and lexemes of \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 are considered as contextual information for computing feature functions in Max-Ent. We now detail the generative process of JTE-P (plate notation in Figure 1 ) as follows: 1 . Omission of a latter index denoted by (\u2022) represents the marginalized sum over the latter index. \ud835\udc58 = (\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc57) denotes the \ud835\udc57 th term of document \ud835\udc51 and the subscript \u00ac\ud835\udc58 denotes the counts excluding the term at (\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc57). \ud835\udf06 1\u2026\ud835\udc5b are the parameters of the learned Max-Ent model corresponding to the \ud835\udc5b binary feature functions \ud835\udc53 1\u2026\ud835\udc5b for Max-Ent. These learned Max-Ent \ud835\udf06 parameters in conjunction with the observed feature context, \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc57 feed the supervision signal for topic/expression switch parameter, r which is updated during inference in equations ( 1) and (2).",

A large number of irrelevant n-grams slow inference. (ii). Filtering irrelevant terms in the vocabulary improves the quality of AD-expressions. Before proceeding, we review some existing approaches. Topics in most topic models like LDA are usually unigram distributions. This offers a great computational advantage compared to more complex models which consider word ordering (Wallach, 2006; Wang et al., 2007) . This thread of research models bigrams by encoding them into the generative process. For each word, a topic is sampled first, then its status as a unigram or bigram is sampled, and finally the word is sampled from a topic-specific unigram or bigram distribution. This method, however, is expensive computationally and has a limitation for arbitrary length n-grams. In (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003) , a language model approach is used for bigram phrase extraction.",

This approach considers adjacent word pairs and identifies n-grams which occur much more often than one would expect by chance alone by computing likelihood ratios. While this is reasonable, a significant n-gram with high likelihood score may not necessarily be relevant to the problem domain. For instance, in our case of discovering AD-expressions, the likelihood score2 of \ud835\udc5d 1 = \"the government of\" happens to be more than \ud835\udc5d 2 = \"I completely disagree\". Clearly, the former is irrelevant for the task of discovering AD-expressions. The reason for this is that likelihood scores or other statistical test scores rely on the relative counts in the multi-way contingency table to compute significance. Since the relative counts of different fragments of the irrelevant phrase \ud835\udc5d 1 , e.g. \"the government\", and \"government of\", happen to appear more than the corresponding counts in the contingency table of \ud835\udc5d 2 , the tests assign a higher score. This is nothing wrong per se because the statistical tests only judge significance of an ngram, but a significant n-gram may not necessarily be relevant in a given problem domain.",

Our notion of relevance of ADexpressions is already encoded into the model using priors set from Max-Ent. Next, we rank the candidate phrases (n-grams) using our probabilistic ranking function. The ranking function is grounded on the following hypothesis: a relevant phrase is one whose unigrams are closely related to (or appear with high probabilities in) the given AD-expression type, \ud835\udc52 : Agreement ( \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc54 ) or disagreement (\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc54).

Precisely, we want to analyze the coverage of our proposed ranking based on relevance models. By coverage, we mean that having selected top k candidate n-grams based on the proposed relevance ranking, we want to get an estimate of how many relevant terms from a sample of the collection were covered. To compute coverage, we randomly sampled 500 documents from the corpus and listed the candidate n-grams 3 in the collection of sampled 500 documents. For this and subsequent human judgment tasks, we use two judges (graduate students well versed in English). We asked our judges to mark all relevant AD-expressions. Agreement study yielded \u03ba Cohen = 0.77 showing substantial agreement according to scale 4 provided in (Landis and Koch, 1977) . This is understandable as identifying AD-expressions is a relatively easy task. Finally, a term was considered to be relevant if both judges marked it so. We then computed the coverage to see how many of the relevant terms in the random sample were also present in top k phrases from the ranked candidate n-grams. We summarize the 3 These are terms appearing at least 20 times in the entire collection. We do this for computational reasons as there can be many n-grams and n-grams with very low frequency are less likely to be relevant. 4 No agreement (\u03ba < 0), slight agreement (0 < \u03ba \u2264 0.2), fair agreement (0.2 < \u03ba \u2264 0.4), moderate agreement (0.4 < \u03ba \u2264 0.6), substantial agreement (0.6 < \u03ba \u2264 0.8), and almost perfect agreement 0.8 < \u03ba \u2264 1.0. We find that choosing top k = 5000 candidate ngrams based on our proposed ranking, we obtain a coverage of 87% for agreement and 89.64 for disagreement expression types which are reasonably good. Thus, we choose top 5000 candidate n-grams for each expression type and add them to the vocabulary beyond all unigrams.",

We use the linear kernel6 SVM (SVM light system in (Joachims, 1999 )) as our text classifier. For feature selection using \u03c7 2 and IG, we use two settings: top 1% and 2% of all features ranked according to the selection metric. Also, for estimated AD-expressions (according to probabilities in \ud835\udf11 \ud835\udc38 ), we experiment with top 1000 and 2000 AD-expressions terms for both agreement and disagreement. We summarize comparison results using 5-fold Cross Validation (CV) with two classes: agreeing and disagreeing in Table 6 .

Although prediction performance using model posterior (JTE-P-posterior) is slightly lower than supervised SVM (Table 6 , second row), the F 1 scores are decent.

This method enables us to find better ADexpressions. Experiments using real-life online debate data showed the effectiveness of the model.
