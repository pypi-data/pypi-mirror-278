                "text": "Automatic discovery of semantically associated words has attracted a large amount of attention in the last decades and a host of computational association measures have been proposed to deal with this task (see Section 2). These measures traditionally rely on the co-ocurrence frequency of two words in a corpus to estimate a relatedness score. There has been a recent emergence of distancebased language modelling techiques in NLP (Savicki and Hlavacova, 2002; Terra and Clarke, 2004) in which the number of tokens separating words is the essential quantity. While some of this work has considered distance-based alternatives to conventional association measures (Hardcastle, 2005; Washtell, 2009) , there has been no principled empirical evaluation of these measures as predictors of human association. We remedy this by conducting a thorough comparison of a wide variety of frequency-based and distance-based measures as predictors of human association scores as elicited in several different free word association tasks.",

This is in contrast to second and higher-order measures which are better predictors of paradigmatic associations, or word similarity. The distinction between syntagmatic and paradigmatic relationship types is neither exact nor mutually exclusive, and many paradigmatic relationships can be observed syntagmatically in the text. Roughly in keeping with (Rapp, 2002) , we hereby regard paradigmatic assocations as those based largely on word similarity (i.e. including those typically classed as synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms etc), whereas syntagmatic associations are all those words which strongly invoke one another yet which cannot readily be said to be similar. Typically these will have an identifiable semantic or grammatical relationship (meronym/holonym: stem -flower, verb/object: eat -food etc), or may have harder-to-classify topical or idiomatic relationships (family -Christmas, rock -roll).",

Therefore improvements made at the level we are concerned with may reasonably be expected to carry through to applications which hinge on the identification of paradigmatic relationships.",

The standard way of estimating the syntagmatic association of word pairs in a corpus is to examine the frequency of their co-occurence, and then usually to compare this to some expected frequency. There are a host of measures which exist for this purpose. After raw co-occurrence frequency, the simplest and most prevalent in the literature is Pointwise Mutual Information, famously used by Church (1989) (as the association ratio). This is defined as the log of the ratio of the observed co-occurrence frequency to the frequency expected under independence. More sophisticated and statistically-informed measures include t-Score, z-Score, Chi-Squared and Log-Likelihood (see Evert (2005) for a thorough review).",

This region might be the entirety of a document at one extreme, or a bigram at the other. A versatile and hugely popular generalised approach is therefore to consider a \"'window\"' of w words, where w can be varied to suit the application. Unsurprisingly, it has been found that this is a parameter which can have a significant impact upon performance (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002; Lamjiri et al., 2004; Wang, 2005) . While choosing an optimum window size for an application is often subject to trial and error, there are some generally recognized trade-offs between small versus large windows, such as the impact of data-sparseness, and the nature of the associations retrieved (Church and Hanks, 1989; Church and Hanks, 1991; Rapp, 2002) Measures based on distance between words in the text. The idea of using distance as an alternative to frequency for modelling language has been touched upon in recent literature (Savicki and Hlavacova, 2002; Terra and Clarke, 2004; Hardcastle, 2005) . Washtell (2009) showed that it is possible to build distance-based analogues of existing syntagmatic association measures, by using the notions of mean and expected distance rather than of frequency. These measures have certain theoretical qualities -notably scale-independence and relative resilience to data-sparseness -which might be expected to provide gains in tasks such as the reproduction of human association norms from corpus data. The specific measure introduced by Washtell, called Co-Dispersion, is based upon an established biogeographic dispersion measure (Clark and Evans, 1954) . We provide a thorough empirical investigation of Co-Dispersion and some of its derivatives herein.",

An alternative might be to validate scores against those derived from a structured resource such as WordNet. However, relatedness measures for WordNet are many and varied and are themselves the subject of evaluation (Pedersen et al., 2004) . Although human association datasets have their own peculiarities, they do at least provide some kind of definite Gold Standard. Yet another alternative might be to incorporate our computational association scores into an application (such as anaphora resolution), and measure the performance of that, but noise from other submodules would complicate evaluation. We leave such extensions to possible future work.",

One popular and statistically appealing such measure is Log-Likelihood (LL) (Dunning, 1993) . LL works on a similar principle to PMI but considers the ratio of the observed to expected co-occurrence frequencies for all contingencies (i.e. including those where the words do not co-occur). LL, as it most frequently appears in the literature, is not actually a measure of positive association: it also responds to significant negative association. Therefore LL is arguably not suited to the task in hand. Krenn & Evert (2001) experiment with one-tailed variants of LL and Chi-Squared measures, although they do not define these variants. Here, we construct a one-tailed variant of LL by simply reversing the signs of the terms which respond to negative association.",

There are a number of ways one might quantify sample size.

In the ideal case therefore, the most popular human response for every cue word would appear at rank 1 amongst the computer-generated responses, resulting in a horizonal line at y=1. Generally speaking therefore, the smaller the area above a line the better the performance of a measure. Three summary statistics can be derived from Figure 2: 1) The number of most popular human responses that are correctly predicted by a measure is indicated by the x-position at which its line departs from y=1.

It can also be seen that the difference between the methods is most pronounced for low frequency cue words, with re-sponses to some cues exhibiting a relative ranking of around one-hundred times lower for the windowed method.

We show that the best windowless measures are always at least as good as the best window-based measures, both when it comes to overall correlation with human association scores and predicting the strongest human response. In addition, for several human association sets, they perform significantly better. Although not all parameter settings and corpus sizes could be explored, we conclude that it is worthwhile investigating windowless association measures further. As a side-benefit, we have also introduced new variants of existing frequency-based association measures and shown them to perform as well as or better than their existing counterparts. Although these measures were semi-principled in their construction, a deeper understanding of why they work so well is needed. This may in turn lead to the construction of superior windowless measures.",
