It has been a specific task in several evaluation pro-grams such as the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC), the Conferences on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), the DARPA HUB-5 program or more recently the French ESTER Rich Transcription program on Broadcast News data. Most of these conferences have studied the impact of using transcripts generated by an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system rather than written texts. It appears from these studies that unlike other IE tasks, NER performance is greatly affected by the Word Error Rate (WER) of the transcripts processed. To tackle this problem, different ideas have been proposed: modeling explicitly the ASR errors (Palmer and Ostendorf, 2001) or using the ASR system alternate hypotheses found in word lattices (Saraclar and Sproat, 2004) . However performance in NER decreases dramatically when processing high WER transcripts like the ones that are obtained with unmatched conditions between the ASR training model and the data to process. This paper investigates this phenomenon in the framework of the NER task of the French Rich Transcription program of Broadcast News ESTER (Gravier et al., 2004) . Several issues are addressed:",

This impact has been shown to be very limited compared to clean text corpora. The main explanation for this phenomenon is the redundancy effect: themes, topics are very likely to be represented in texts by many occurrences of salient words characterizing them. Therefore, even if some of these words are missing, numerical Information Extraction methods can use the remaining salient words and discard the noise generated by ASR errors. However, this phenomenon is not true for tasks related to the extraction of fine grained entities, like Named Entities. Indeed, several studies have shown that F-measure and WER are strongly correlated : 0.7 points of F-measure lost for each additional 1% of WER according to (Miller et al., 2000) on the experiments of 1998 NIST Hub-4 evaluations (Przybocki et al., 1999) .",

Moreover, Named Entities extraction performance is greatly affected by a mismatch between training and testing data. This is due mainly because proper names, which represent most of the Named Entity items, are a very dynamic category of words, strongly related to the period of time representing the documents to process. Therefore this mismatch is inevitable when dealing with archives spreading over a long period of time and containing multiple domain information.",

Although such collected data can be used to update the ASR and NER models, the potential gain is rather small unless the metadata corpus gathered fits perfectly the document to process and is of a reasonable size. But another way of exploiting this metadata information is to use it as set of index terms that are going to be explicitly looked for in the processed documents.

Besides the intrinsic difficulties of ASR (robustness to noise, speaker variation, lack of coverage of the Language Models used, . . . ), there is a source of errors which is particularly important in IE from speech input: the Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) word phenomenon. Indeed, ASR models are built on huge textual corpus and only contain the most frequent words to limit computation and memory usage. If this is the right approach to WER reduction, it is certainly not valuable to information extraction where unlikely events are considered as important. For instance, many document retrieval models use inverse document frequency (rareness) as a word weighting parameter. So, unlikely proper names are not in reach of the ASR transcription system and hence cannot be spotted by a Named Entity extraction module.",

In this approach, there must be one tag per word. Words starting and ending entities are labeled with special tags.

These FSMs are transducers that accept word sequences on the input symbols and output NE labels on the output symbols. They are all grouped together in a single transducer, called T gram , with a filler model that accepts any string of words. Because these FSMs are lexicalized with the words of the ASR lexicon, one can control the generalization capabilities of the grammars thanks to the occurrence contexts of these words in the training corpus.

The unmatched test corpus is made of Broadcast News ranging from October 10th to October 16th 2004. The following observations were made: 72% of the NEs and 60% of the words contained in them occur only one day in this corpus; the intersection of the NEs occurring in both the newsletter of a particular day and the entities belonging to the unmatched test corpus shows a peak, illustrated by figure 3 , for the days of the test corpus; at this peak, 25% of the NEs are used the same day in the two corpora. The first observation matches those presented in (Whittaker, 2001) and validates our approach which consists in carefully adapting the ASR and NER models with data corresponding to the exact period of time as the one of the documents to process: by taking into account a larger period of time for the adaptation corpus, the necessity of restraining the models to the most frequent entities would lead to discard low frequency terms that can be crucial for characterizing the news of a given day.",

Depending on the adaptation method and the kind of metadata information used, some gains in performance have been reported. But it appears that the choice of the metadata and the size of the adaptation corpus collected are critical in this adaptation process: if the adaptation corpus is not exactly related to the topics of the document to process, no real gains are obtained (e.g. (Chen et al., 2004) reports that the best gains were obtained with a story-based adaptation method).",

A comparison between this approach and a standard approach based on the NLP tools Lingpipe validates our hypotheses. This integration of the ASR and the NER processes is particularly important in difficult conditions like those that can be found in large spoken archives where the training corpus does not match all the documents to process. A study of the use of metadata information in order to adapt the ASR and NER models to a specific situation showed that if the overall improvement is small, some salient information related to the metadata added can be better extracted by means of this adaptation.",
