Classification of such relationships is an important and difficult task (for example, the well known noun compound classification task is a special case of this problem). We propose a novel pattern clusters method for nominal relationship (NR) classification. Pattern clusters are discovered in a large corpus independently of any particular training set, in an unsupervised manner. Each of the extracted clusters corresponds to some unspecified semantic relationship. The pattern clusters are then used to construct features for training and classification of specific inter-nominal relationships. Our NR classification evaluation strictly follows the ACL SemEval-07 Task 4 datasets and protocol, obtaining an f-score of 70.6, as opposed to 64.8 of the best previous work that did not use the manually provided WordNet sense disambiguation tags.",

A prominent type of semantic relationships is that holding between nominals1 .

These two relationships are completely different semantically but are similar syntactically, and distinguishing between them could be essential for NLP applications such as question answering and machine translation.",

To improve results, some systems utilize additional manually constructed semantic resources such as WordNet (WN) (Beamer et al., 2007) . However, in many domains and languages such resources are not available. Furthermore, usage of such resources frequently requires disambiguation and connection of the data to the resource (word sense disambiguation in the case of WordNet). Manual disambiguation is unfeasible in many practical tasks, and an automatic one may introduce errors and greatly degrade performance. It thus makes sense to try to minimize the usage of such resources, and utilize only corpus contexts in which the relevant words appear.",

Accordingly, we construct pattern clusters from a large generic corpus, each such cluster potentially representing some important generic relationship. This step is done without accessing any training data, anticipating that most meaningful relationships, including those in a given classification problem, will be represented by some of the discovered clusters. We then use the training set to label some of the clusters, and the labeled clusters to assign classes to tested items. One of the advantages of our method is that it can be used not only for classification, but also for further analysis and retrieval of the observed relationships2 .",

Recently, SemEval-07 Task 4 (Girju et al., 2007) proposed a benchmark dataset that includes a subset of 7 widely accepted nominal relationship (NR) classes, allowing consistent evaluation of different NR classification algorithms. In the SemEval event, 14 research teams evaluated their algorithms using this benchmark. Some of the teams have used the manually annotated WN labels provided with the dataset, and some have not.",

We do not take words from the sentence 'In European soccer there are transfers and loans...' since its context does not contain the word students.
