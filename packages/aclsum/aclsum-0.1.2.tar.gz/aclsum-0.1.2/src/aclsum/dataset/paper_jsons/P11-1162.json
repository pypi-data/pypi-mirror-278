    "abstract": "Text mining and data harvesting algorithms have become popular in the computational linguistics community. They employ patterns that specify the kind of information to be harvested, and usually bootstrap either the pattern learning or the term harvesting process (or both) in a recursive cycle, using data learned in one step to generate more seeds for the next. They therefore treat the source text corpus as a network, in which words are the nodes and relations linking them are the edges. The results of computational network analysis, especially from the world wide web, are thus applicable. Surprisingly, these results have not yet been broadly introduced into the computational linguistics community. In this paper we show how various results apply to text mining, how they explain some previously observed phenomena, and how they can be helpful for computational linguistics applications.",

They generally start with one or more seed terms and employ patterns that specify the desired information as it relates to the seed(s). Several approaches have been developed specifically for learning patterns, including guided pattern collection with manual filtering (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997 ) automated surface-level pattern induction (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) probabilistic methods for taxonomy relation learning (Snow et al., 2005) and kernel methods for relation learning (Zelenko et al., 2003) . Generally, the harvesting procedure is recursive, in which data (terms or patterns) gathered in one step of a cycle are used as seeds in the following step, to gather more terms or patterns.",

Broder et al. (2000) demonstrated that the Web link structure has a \"bow-tie\" shape, while (2001) classified Web pages into authorities (pages with relevant information) and hubs (pages with useful references). These findings resulted in the development of the PageRank (Page et al., 1999) algorithm which analyzes the structure of the hyperlinks of Web documents to find pages with authoritative information.

Understanding the semantics of nouns, verbs, and adjectives has been of great interest to linguists and cognitive scientists such as (Gentner, 1981; Levin and Somers, 1993; Gasser and Smith, 1998) . We implement a general harvesting procedure and show its results for these word types. A fundamental difference with the work of (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2004 ) is that we study very large semantic networks built 'naturally' by (millions of) users rather than 'artificially' by a small set of experts. The large networks capture the semantic intuitions and knowledge of the collective mass. It is conceivable that an analysis of this knowledge can begin to form the basis of a large-scale theory of semantic meaning and its interconnections, support observation of the process of lexical development and usage in humans, and even suggest explanations of how knowledge is organized in our brains, especially when performed for differ-ent languages on the WWW.",

On the face of it, one would need to know the structure of the network a priori to be able to provide answers. But research has shown that some surprising regularities hold. For example, in the text mining community, (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b ) have shown that one can obtain a quite accurate estimate of the eventual yield of a pattern and seed after only five steps of harvesting.

The indegree of a node u denoted as indegree(u)= (v, u) considers the sum of all incoming edges to u and captures the ability of a semantic term to be discovered by other semantic terms. The outdegree of a node u denoted as outdegree(u)= (u, v) considers the number of outgoing edges of the node u and measures the ability of a semantic term to discover new terms.

This shows that for the text-mined semantic networks, the ability of a term to discover new terms is more important than the ability to be discovered. This poses the question \"What are the terms with high and low outdegree?\". The nodes with high outdegree correspond to famous or contemporary singers. The lower-ranked nodes are mostly spelling errors such as Alanis Morisette and Christine Agulera, less known singers such as Buffy Sainte-Marie and Cece Winans, non-American singers such as Alejandro Sanz and France Gall, extractions due to part-of-speech tagging errors such as Billie Celebration, and general terms such as Peter and Sarah. Potentially, knowing which terms have a high outdegree allows one to rerank candidate seeds for more effective harvesting.",

Similarly to the Web (Broder et al., 2000) and social networks like Orkut and Flickr, the textmined semantic networks also exhibit a power-law distribution. This means that while a few terms have a significantly high degree, the majority of the semantic terms have small degree. Figure 2 shows the indegree and outdegree distributions for different semantic classes, lexico-syntactic patterns, and languages (English and Spanish). For each semantic network, we plot the best-fitting power-law function (Clauset et al., 2009) which fits well all degree distributions. Table 4 It is interesting to note that the indegree powerlaw exponents for all semantic networks fall within the same range (\u03b3 in \u2248 2.4), and similarly for the outdegree exponents (\u03b3 out \u2248 1.3). However, the values of the indegree and outdegree exponents differ from each other. This observation is consistent with Web degree distributions (Broder et al., 2000) . The difference in the distributions can be explained by the link asymmetry of semantic terms: A discovering B does not necessarily mean that B will discover A. In the text-mined semantic networks, this asymmetry is caused by patterns of language use, such as the fact that people use first adjectives of the size and then of the color (e.g., big red car), or prefer to place male before female proper names. Harvesting patterns should take into account this tendency.",

The diameter of the SCC is calculated as the maximum distance over all pairs of nodes (u, v), such that a node v is reachable from node u. Table 5 shows the average distance and the diameter of the semantic networks. The diameter shows the maximum number of steps necessary to reach from any node to any other, while the average distance shows the number of steps necessary on average. Overall, all networks have very short average path lengths and small diameters that are consistent with Watt's finding for small-world networks.

JDD is approximated by the degree correlation function k nn which maps the outdegree and the average indegree of all nodes connected to a node with that outdegree.

A positive assortivity coefficient means that the nodes tend to connect to nodes of similar degree, while negative coefficient means that nodes are likely to connect to nodes with degree very different from their own. We find that the assortivitiy coefficient of our semantic networks is positive, ranging from 0.07 to 0.20. In this respect, the semantic networks differ from the Web, which has a negative assortivity (Newman, 2003) . This implies a difference in text mining and web search traversal strategies: since starting from a highly-connected seed term will tend to lead to other highly-connected terms, text mining algorithms should prefer depthfirst traversal, while web search algorithms starting from a highly-connected seed page should prefer a breadth-first strategy.",

We can therefore apply some of the research from network analysis to text mining. The small-world phenomenon, for example, holds that any node is connected to any other node in at most six steps. Since as shown in Section 4.5 the semantic networks also exhibit this phenomenon, we can explain the observation of (Kozareva and Hovy, 2010b) that one can quite accurately predict the relative 'goodness' of a seed term (its eventual total yield and the number of steps required to obtain that) within five harvesting steps. We have shown that due to the strongly connected components in text mining networks, not all elements within the harvested graph can discover each other. This implies that harvesting algorithms have to be started with several seeds to obtain adequate Recall (Vyas et al., 2009) . We have shown that centrality measures can be used successfully to rank harvested terms to guide the network traversal, and to validate the correctness of the harvested terms.",
