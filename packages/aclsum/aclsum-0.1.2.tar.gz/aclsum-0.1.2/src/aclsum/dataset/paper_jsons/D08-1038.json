We apply unsupervised topic modeling to the ACL Anthology to analyze historical trends in the field of Computational Linguistics from 1978 to 2006. We induce topic clusters using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and examine the strength of each topic over time. Our methods find trends in the field including the rise of probabilistic methods starting in 1988, a steady increase in applications, and a sharp decline of research in semantics and understanding between 1978 and 2001, possibly rising again after 2001. We also introduce a model of the diversity of ideas, topic entropy, using it to show that COLING is a more diverse conference than ACL, but that both conferences as well as EMNLP are becoming broader over time. Finally, we apply Jensen-Shannon divergence of topic distributions to show that all three conferences are converging in the topics they cover.",

Computational linguistics has an advantage, however: the ACL Anthology, a public repository of all papers in the Computational Linguistics journal and the conferences and workshops associated with the ACL, COLING, EMNLP, and so on. The ACL Anthology (Bird, 2008) , and comprises over 14,000 documents from conferences and the journal, beginning as early as 1965 through 2008, indexed by conference and year. This resource has already been the basis of citation analysis work, for example, in the ACL Anthology Network of Joseph and Radev (2007) . We apply LDA to the text of the papers in the ACL Anthology to induce topics, and use the trends in these topics over time and over conference venues to address questions about the development of the field. Despite the relative youth of our field, computational linguistics has witnessed a number of research trends and shifts in focus. While some trends are obvious (such as the rise in machine learning methods), others may be more subtle. Has the field gotten more theoretical over the years or has there been an increase in applications? What topics have declined over the years, and which ones have remained roughly constant? How have fields like Dialogue or Machine Translation changed over the years? Are there differences among the conferences, for example between COLING and ACL, in their interests and breadth of focus? As our field matures, it is important to go beyond anecdotal description to give grounded answers to these questions. Such answers could also help give formal metrics to model the differences between the many conferences and venues in our field, which could influence how we think about reviewing, about choosing conference topics, and about long range planning in our field.",

In order to distinguish these two topics, we show 20 of the strongly weighted words: As Figure 1 shows, probabilistic models seem to have arrived significantly before classifiers. The probabilistic model topic increases around 1988, which seems to have been an important year for probabilistic models, including high-impact papers like A88-1019 and C88-1016 below. The ten papers from 1988 with the highest weights for the probabilistic model and classifier topics were the following: probabilistic models and classifiers entered the field? First, not surprisingly, we note that the vast majority (9 of 10) of the papers appeared in conference proceedings rather than the journal, confirming that in general new ideas appear in conferences. Second, of the 9 conference papers, most of them appeared in the COLING conference (5) or the ANLP workshop (3) compared to only 1 in the ACL conference. This suggests that COLING may have been more receptive than ACL to new ideas at the time, a point we return to in Section 6. Finally, we examined the background of the authors of these papers. Six of the 10 papers either focus on speech (C88-1010, A88-1028, C88-1071) or were written by authors who had previously published on speech recognition topics, including the influential IBM (Brown et al.) and AT&T (Church) labs (C88-1016, A88-1005, A88-1019). Speech recognition is historically an electrical engineering field which made quite early use of probabilistic and statistical methodologies. This suggests that researchers working on spoken language processing were an important conduit for the borrowing of statistical methodologies into computational linguistics.",

We then plotted p(z \u2208 S|y), the sum of the proportions per year for these topics, as shown in Figure 3 . The steep decrease in semantics is readily apparent. The last few years has shown a levelling off of the decline, and possibly a revival of this topic; this possibility will need to be confirmed as we add data from 2007 and 2008. We next chose two fields, Dialogue and Machine Translation, in which it seemed to us that the topics discovered by LDA suggested a shift in paradigms in these fields.

Entropy measures the average amount of information expressed by each assignment to a random variable. If a conference has higher topic entropy, then it more evenly divides its probability mass across the generated topics. If it has lower, it has a far more narrow focus on just a couple of topics. We therefore measured topic entropy:",

We removed from the ACL and COLING lines the years when ACL and COLING are colocated (1984, 1998, 2006) , and marked those colocated years as points separate from either plot. As expected, COLING has been historically the broadest of the three conferences, though perhaps slightly less so in recent years. ACL started with a fairly narrow focus, but became nearly as broad as COLING during the 1990's. However, in the past 8 years it has become more narrow again, with a steeper decline in breadth than COLING. EMNLP, true to its status as a \"Special Interest\" conference, began as a very narrowly focused conference, but now it seems to be catching up to at least ACL in terms of the breadth of its focus.",
