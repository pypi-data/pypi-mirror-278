The algorithms tested include statistical, neural-network, decision-tree, rule-based, and case-based classification techniques. The specific problem tested involves disambiguating six senses of the word \"line\" using the words in the current and proceeding sentence as context.

Three general approaches are statistical, neural-network, and symbolic machine learning and numerous specific methods have been developed under each of these paradigms (Wermter, Riloff, & Scheler, 1996; Charniak, 1993; Reilly & Sharkey, 1992 ). An important question is whether some methods perform significantly better than others on particular types of problems. Unfortunately, there have been very few direct comparisons of alternative methods on identical test data.",

Also, comparisons of Bayesian, information-retrieval, neural-network, and case-based methods on word-sense disambiguation have also demonstrated similar performance (Leacock, Towell, & Voorhees, 1993b; Lehman, 1994) . However, in a comparison of neural-network and decision-tree methods on learning to generate the past tense of an English verb, decision trees performed significantly better (Ling & Marinov, 1993; Ling, 1994) . Subsequent experiments on this problem have demonstrated that an inductive logic programming method produces even better results than decision trees (Mooney & Califf, 1995) .",

Tests on all methods used identical training and test sets, and ten separate random trials were run in order to measure average performance and allow statistical testing of the significance of any observed differences. On this particular task, we found that the Bayesian and perceptron methods perform significantly better than the remaining methods and discuss a potential reason for this observed difference. We also discuss the role of bias in machine learning and its importance in explaining the observed differences in the performance of alternative methods on specific problems.",

However, averaging over a uniform distribution of all possible functions is effectively equivalent to assuming a \"random universe\" in which the past is not predictive of the future.

Most learning algorithms have some sort of \"Occam's razor\" bias in which hypotheses that can be represented with fewer bits in some particular representation language are preferred (Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, gz Warmuth, 1987) . However, the compactness with which different representation languages (e.g. decision trees, DNF, linear threshold networks) can represent particular functions can vary dramatically (e.g. see Pagallo and Haussler (1990) ).

The corpus was assembled from the 1987-89 Wall Street Journal and a 25 million word corpus from the American Printing House for the Blind. Sentences containing \"line\" were extracted and assigned a single sense from WordNet (Miller, 1991) . There are a total of 4,149 examples in the full corpus unequally distributed across the six senses. Due to the use of the Wall Street Journal, the \"product\" sense is more than 5 times as common as any of the others. Previous studies have first sampled the data so that all senses were equally represented. Leacock et al. (1993b) , Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993a) and Voorhees, Leacock, and Towell (1995) present results on a Bayesian method (Gale, Church, & Yarowsky, 1992a) , a content vector method from information retrieval (Salton, Wong, & Yang, 1975) , and a neural network trained using backpropagation (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) . The neural network architecture that performed at least as well as any other contained no hidden units, so was effectively equivalent to a perceptron. On the six-sense task trained on 1,200 examples and averaged over three random trials, they report the following generalization accuracies: Bayesian, 71%; content vectors, 72%; neural nets, 76%.

Some recent results have indicated that representing concepts in CNF (a conjunction of disjunctions) frequently performs somewhat better (Mooney, 1995) . Some concepts are more compactly represented in CNF compared to DNF and vice versa. Therefore, both representations are included. Finally, decision lists (Rivest, 1987) are ordered lists of conjunctive rules, where rules are tested in order and the first one that matches an instance is used to classify it. A number of effective concept-learning systems have employed decision lists (Clark Niblett, 1989; Quinlan, 1993; Mooney & Califf, 1995) and they have already been successfully applied to lexical disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1994) .",

We believe they are important since they reveal how algorithms perform with varying amounts of training data and how their performance improves with additional training. Results on a fixed-sized training set gives only one data point on the learning curve and leaves the possibility that differences between algorithms are hidden due to a ceiling effect, in which there are sufficient training examples for all methods to reach near Bayes-optimal performance, s Learning aBayes-optimal performance is achieved by always picking the category with the maximum probability given all of its features. This requires actually knowing the conditional probability of each category given each of the exponentially large number of possible instance descriptions. curves generally follow a power law where predictive accuracy climbs fairly rapidly and then levels off at an asymptotic level. A learning curve can reveal whether the performance of a system is approaching an asymptote or whether additional training data would likely result in significant improvement. Since gathering annotated training data is an expensive time-consuming process, it is important to understand the performance of methods given varying amounts of training data.",

Unfortunately, most results reported in empirical natural-language research present only a single or very small number of tri-Ms. Running multiple trials also allows for statistical testing of the significance of any resulting differences in average performance. We employ a simple two-tailed, paired t-test to compare the performance of two systems for a given trainingset size, requiring significance at the 0.05 level. Even more sophisticated statistical analysis of the results is perhaps warranted.",

The decision-tree and logic-based approaches all attempt to find a combination of a relatively small set of features that accurately predict classification. After training on 1,200 examples, the symbolic structures learned for the line corpus are relatively large. Average sizes are 369 leaves for C4.5 decision trees, 742 literals for PFoIL-DLIST decision lists, 841 literals for PFoIL-DNF formulae, and 1197 literals for PFoIL-CNF formulae. However, many nodes or literals can test the same feature and the last two results include the total literal count for six separate DNF or CNF formulae (one for each sense). Therefore, each discrimination is clearly only testing a relatively small fraction of the 2,859 available features. Nearest neighbor bases its classifications on all features; however, it weights them all equally. Therefore, differential weighting is apparently necessary for high-performance on this problem. Alternative instance-based methods that weight features based on their predictive ability have also been developed (Aha et al., 1991) . Therefore, our results indicate that lexical disambiguation is perhaps best performed using methods that combine weighted evidence from all of the features rather tures actually present in the examples. Without this optimization, testing would have been several orders of magnitude slower. than making a decision by testing only a small subset of highly predictive features. Among the other methods tested, decision lists seem to perform the best. The ordering of rules employed in a decision list in order to simplify the representation and perform conflict resolution apparently gives it an advantage over other symbolic methods on this task. In addition to the results reported by Yarowsky (1994) and Mooney and Califf (1995) , it provides evidence for the utility of this representation for natural-language problems.",

With respect to accuracy, naive Bayes and perceptron perform significantly better (p _< 0.05) than all other methods for all training-set sizes. Naive Bayes and perceptron are not significantly different, except at 1,200 training examples where naive Bayes has a slight advantage. Note that the results for 1,200 training examples are comparable to those obtained by Leacock et al. (1993b) for similar methods. PFOIL-DLIsT is always significantly better than PFoIL-DNF and PFoIL-CNF and significantly better than 3 Nearest Neighbor and C4.5 at 600 and 1,200 training examples.
