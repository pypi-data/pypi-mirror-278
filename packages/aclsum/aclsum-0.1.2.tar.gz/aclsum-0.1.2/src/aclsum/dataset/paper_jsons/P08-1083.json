For the task of full morphological analysis, the lexicon must provide all possible morphological analyses for any given token. In this case, unknown tokens can be categorized into two classes of missing information: unknown tokens are not recognized at all by the lexicon, and unknown analyses, where the set of analyses for a lexeme does not contain the correct analysis for a given token. Despite efforts on improving the underlying lexicon, unknowns typically represent 5% to 10% of the number of tokens in large-scale corpora. The alternative to continuously investing manual effort in improving the lexicon is to design methods to learn possible analyses for unknowns from observable features: their letter structure and their context. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of Hebrew unknowns for full morphological analysis, and propose a new method for handling such unavoidable lack of information. Our method generates a distribution of possible analyses for unknowns. In our evaluation, these learned distributions include the correct analysis for unknown words in 85% of the cases, contributing an error reduction of over 30% over a competitive baseline for the overall task of full morphological analysis in Hebrew.",

In this work, we refer to the morphological analyzer of MILA -the Knowledge Center for Processing Hebrew 2 (hereafter KC analyzer). It is a synthetic analyzer, composed of two data resources -a lexicon of about 2,400 lexemes, and a set of generation rules (see (Adler, 2007, Section 4.2) ). In addition, we use an unlabeled text corpus, composed of stories taken from three Hebrew daily news papers (Aruts 7, Haaretz, The Marker), of 42M tokens. We observed 3,561 different composite tags (e.g., noun-sing-fem-prepPrefix:be) over this corpus. These 3,561 tags form the large tagset over which we train our learner. On the one hand, this tagset is much larger than the largest tagset used in English (from 17 tags in most unsupervised POS tagging experiments, to the 46 tags of the WSJ corpus and the about 150 tags of the LOB corpus). On the other hand, our tagset is intrinsically factored as a set of dependent sub-features, which we explicitly represent.",

In order to classify these unknown tokens, we sampled 10K unknown token types and examined them manually. The classification of these tokens with their distribution is shown in Table 1 3 . As can be seen, there are two main classes of unknown token types: Neologisms (32%) and Proper nouns (48%), which cover about 80% of the unknown token instances.

The POS distribution of the unknown analyses is listed in Table 2 . The high rate of unknown analyses for prepositions at about 3% is a specific phenomenon in Hebrew, where prepositions are often prefixes agglutinated to the first word of the noun phrase they head. We observe the very low rate of unknown verbs (2%) -which are well marked morphologically in Hebrew, and where the rate of neologism introduction seems quite low. This evidence illustrates the need for resolution of unknowns: The naive policy of selecting 'proper name' for all unknowns will cover only half of the errors caused by unknown tokens, i.e., 30% of the whole unknown tokens and analyses. The other 70% of the unknowns ( 5.3% of the words in the text in our experiments) will be assigned a wrong tag.",

A naive approach would assign all possible analyses for each unknown token with uniform distribution, and continue disambiguation on the basis of a learned model with this initial distribution. The performance of a tagger with such a policy is actually poor: there are dozens of tags in the tagset (3,561 in the case of Hebrew full morphological disambiguation) and only a few of them may match a given token. Several heuristics were developed to reduce the possibility space and to assign a distribution for the remaining analyses. Weischedel et al. (1993) combine several heuristics in order to estimate the token generation probability according to various types of informationsuch as the characteristics of particular tags with respect to unknown tokens (basically the distribution shown in Table 2 ), and simple spelling features: capitalization, presence of hyphens and specific suffixes. An accuracy of 85% in resolving unknown tokens was reported. Dermatas and Kokkinakis (1995) suggested a method for guessing unknown tokens based on the distribution of the hapax legomenon, and reported an accuracy of 66% for English. Mikheev (1997) suggested a guessing-rule technique, based on prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules, and ending-guessing rules. These rules are learned automatically from raw text. They reported a tagging accuracy of about 88%. Thede and Harper (1999) extended a second-order HMM model with a C = c k,i matrix, in order to encode the probability of a token with a suffix s k to be generated by a tag t i .

                "text": "Nakagawa ( 2004) combine word-level and character-level information for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation. At the word level, a segmented word is attached to a POS, where the character model is based on the observed characters and their classification: Begin of word, In the middle of a word, End of word, the character is a word itself S. They apply Baum-Welch training over a segmented corpus, where the segmentation of each word and its character classification is observed, and the POS tagging is ambiguous. The segmentation (of all words in a given sentence) and the POS tagging (of the known words) is based on a Viterbi search over a lattice composed of all possible word segmentations and the possible classifications of all observed characters. Their experimental results show that the method achieves high accuracy over state-of-the-art methods for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation. Hebrew also suffers from ambiguous segmentation of agglutinated tokens into significant words, but word formation rules seem to be quite different from Chinese and Japanese. We also could not rely on the existence of an annotated corpus of segmented word forms. Habash and Rambow (2006) used the root+pattern+features representation of Arabic tokens for morphological analysis and generation of Arabic dialects, which have no lexicon. They report high recall (95%-98%) but low precision (37%-63%) for token types and token instances, against gold-standard morphological analysis. We also exploit the morphological patterns characteristic of semitic morphology, but extend the guessing of morphological features by using contextual features. We also propose a method that relies exclusively on learned character-level features and contextual features, and eventually reaches the same performance as the patterns-based approach. Mansour et al. (2007) combine a lexicon-based tagger (such as MorphTagger (Bar-Haim et al., 2005) ), and a character-based tagger (such as the data-driven ArabicSVM (Diab et al., 2004 )), which includes character features as part of its classification model, in order to extend the set of analyses suggested by the analyzer. For a given sentence, the lexicon-based tagger is applied, selecting one tag for a token. In case the ranking of the tagged sentence is lower than a threshold, the character-based tagger is applied, in order to produce new possible analyses.

The model is trained on the known tokens that appear in the corpus. For each analysis of a known token, the following features are extracted: (1) unigram, bigram, and trigram letters of the base-word (for each analysis, the base-word is the token without prefixes), together with their index relative to the start and end of the word. For example, the n-gram features extracted for the word abc are { a:1 b:2 c:3 a:-3 b:-2 c:-1 ab:1 bc:2 ab:-2 bc:-1 abc:1 abc:-1 } ; (2) the prefixes of the base-word (as a single feature); (3) the length of the base-word. The class assigned to this set of features, is the analysis of the base-word. The model is trained on all the known tokens of the corpus, each token is observed with its possible POS-tags once for each of its occurrences. When an unknown token is found, the model is applied as follows: all the possible linguistic prefixes are extracted from the token (one of the 76 prefix sequences that can occur in Hebrew); if more than one such prefix is found, the token is analyzed for each possible prefix. For each possible such segmentation, the full feature vector is constructed, and submitted to the Maximum Entropy model. We hypothesize a uniform distribution among the possible segmentations and aggregate a distribution of possible tags for the analysis. If the proposed tag of the base-word is never found in the corpus preceded by the identified prefix, we remove this possible analysis. The eventual outcome of the model application is a set of possible full morphological analyses for the token -in exactly the same format as the morphological analyzer provides.",
