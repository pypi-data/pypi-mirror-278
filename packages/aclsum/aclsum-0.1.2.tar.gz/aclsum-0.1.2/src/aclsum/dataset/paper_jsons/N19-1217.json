                "text": "There exists a class of language construction known as pun in natural language texts and utterances, where a certain word or other lexical items are used to exploit two or more separate meanings. It has been shown that understanding of puns is an important research question with various real-world applications, such as human-computer interaction (Morkes et al., 1999; Hempelmann, 2008) and machine translation (Schr\u00f6ter, 2005) . Recently, many researchers show their interests in studying puns, like detecting pun sentences (Vadehra, 2017) , locating puns in the text (Cai et al., 2018) , interpreting pun sentences (Sevgili et al., 2017) and generating sentences containing puns (Ritchie, 2005; Hong and Ong, 2009; Yu et al., 2018) . A pun is a wordplay in which a certain word suggests two or more meanings by exploiting polysemy, homonymy, or phonological similarity to another sign, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. Puns can be generally categorized into two groups, namely hetero-graphic puns (where the pun and its latent target are phonologically similar) and homographic puns (where the two meanings of the pun reflect its two distinct senses) (Miller et al., 2017) . Consider the following two examples:",

The goal of pun location is to find the exact word appearing in the text that implies more than one meanings. Most previous work addresses such two tasks separately and develop separate systems (Pramanick and Das, 2017; Sevgili et al., 2017) . Typically, a system for pun detection is built to make a binary prediction on whether a sentence contains a pun or not, where all instances (with or without puns) are taken into account during training. For the task of pun location, a separate system is used to make a single prediction as to which word in the given sentence in the text that trigger more than one semantic interpretations of the text, where the training data involves only sentences that contain a pun. Therefore, if one is interested in solving both problems at the same time, a pipeline approach that performs pun detection followed by pun location can be used.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the detection and location of puns can be jointly addressed by a single model. The pun detection and location tasks can be combined as a sequence labeling problem, which allows us to jointly detect and locate a pun in a sentence by assigning each word a tag. Since each context contains a maximum of one pun (Miller et al., 2017) , we design a novel tagging scheme to capture this structural constraint. Statistics on the corpora also show that a pun tends to appear in the second half of a context. To capture such a structural property, we also incorporate word position knowledge into our structured prediction model. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that detection and location tasks can reinforce each other, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on these two tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs joint detection and location of English puns by using a sequence labeling approach.1 2 Approach",

Under the two schemes, if a sentence does not contain any puns, all words will be tagged with N or B, respectively. Exemplified by the second sentence \"Some diets cause a gut reaction,\" the pun is given as \"gut.\" Thus, under the BPA scheme, it should be tagged with P, while the words before it are assigned with the tag B and words after it are with A, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Likewise, the NP scheme tags the word \"gut\" with P, while other words are tagged with N.

In this work, we adopt the bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) networks on top of the Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) (CRF) architecture to make labeling decisions, which is one of the classical models for sequence labeling. Our model architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 with a running example. Given a context/sentence x = (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ) where n is the length of the context, we generate the corresponding tag sequence y = (y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y n ) based on our designed tagging schemes and the original annotations for pun detection and location provided by the corpora. Our model is then trained on pairs of (x, y). Input. The contexts in the pun corpus hold the property that each pun contains exactly one content word, which can be either a noun, a verb, an adjective, or an adverb. To capture this characteristic, we consider lexical features at the character level. Similar to the work of (Liu et al., 2018) , the character embeddings are trained by the character-level LSTM networks on the unannotated input sequences. Nonlinear transformations are then applied to the character embeddings by highway networks (Srivastava et al., 2015) , which map the character-level features into different semantic spaces.",

We can see that our model with the BPA tagging scheme yields new state-of-the-art F 1 scores on pun detection and competitive results on pun location, compared to baselines that do not adopt joint learning in the first block. For location on heterographic puns, our model's performance is slightly lower than the system of (Vechtomova, 2017) , which is a rulebased locator. Compared to CRF, we can see that our model, either with the NP or the BPA scheme, yields significantly higher recall on both detection and location tasks, while the precisions are relatively close.

After studying outputs from these two approaches, we found that one leading source of error for the NP approach is that there exist more than one words in a single instance that are assigned with the P tag. However, according to the description of pun in (Miller et al., 2017) , each context contains a maximum of one pun. Thus, such a useful structural constraint is not well captured by the simple approach based on the NP tagging scheme. On the other hand, by applying the BPA tagging scheme, such a constraint is properly captured in the model. As a result, the results for such a approach are significantly better than the approach based on the NP tagging scheme, as we can observe from the table. Under the same experimental setup, we also attempted to exclude word position features. Results are given by BPAp. It is expected that the performance of pun location drops, since such position features are able to capture the interesting property that a pun tends to appear in the second half of a sentence. While such knowledge is helpful for the location task, interestingly, a model without position knowledge yields improved performance on the pun detection task. One possible reason is that detecting whether a sentence contains a pun is not concerned with such word position information.",

We found the errors can be broadly categorized into several types, and we elaborate them here. 1) Low word coverage: since the corpora are relatively small, there exist many unseen words in the test set. Learning the representations of such unseen words is challeng-ing, which affects the model's performance. Such errors contribute around 40% of the total errors made by our system. 2) Detection errors: we found many errors are due to the model's inability to make correct pun detection. Such inability harms both pun detection and pun location. Although our approach based on the BPA tagging scheme yields relatively higher scores on the detection task, we still found that 40% of the incorrectly predicted instances fall into this group. 3) Short sentences: we found it was challenging for our model to make correct predictions when the given text is short. Consider the example \"Superglue! Tom rejoined,\" here the word rejoined is the corresponding pun. However, it would be challenging to figure out the pun with such limited contextual information.",

                "text": "Most existing systems address pun detection and location separately. Pedersen (2017) applied word sense knowledge to conduct pun detection. Indurthi and Oota (2017) trained a bidirectional RNN classifier for detecting homographic puns. Next, a knowledge-based approach is adopted to find the exact pun. Such a system is not applicable to heterographic puns. Doogan et al. (2017) applied Google n-gram and word2vec to make decisions. The phonetic distance via the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary is computed to detect heterographic puns. Pramanick and Das (2017) used the hidden Markov model and a cyclic dependency network with rich features to detect and locate puns. Mikhalkova and Karyakin (2017) used a supervised approach to pun detection and a weakly supervised approach to pun location based on the position within the context and part of speech features. Vechtomova (2017) proposed a rulebased system for pun location that scores candidate words according to eleven simple heuristics. Two systems are developed to conduct detection and location separately in the system known as UWAV (Vadehra, 2017) . The pun detector combines predictions from three classifiers. The pun locator considers word2vec similarity between every pair of words in the context and position to pinpoint the pun. The state-of-the-art system for homographic pun location is a neural method (Cai et al., 2018) , where the word senses are incorporated into a bidirectional LSTM model. This method only supports the pun location task on ho-mographic puns. Another line of research efforts related to this work is sequence labeling, such as POS tagging, chunking, word segmentation and NER. The neural methods have shown their effectiveness in this task, such as BiLSTM-CNN (Chiu and Nichols, 2016) , GRNN (Xu and Sun, 2016) , LSTM-CRF (Lample et al., 2016) , LSTM-CNN-CRF (Ma and Hovy, 2016), LM-LSTM-CRF (Liu et al., 2018) .",

Such a scheme guarantees that there is a maximum of one word that will be tagged as a pun during the testing phase. We also found the interesting structural property such as the fact that most puns tend to appear at the second half of the sentences can be helpful for such a task, but was not explored in previous works. Furthermore, unlike many previous approaches, our approach, though simple, is generally applicable to both heterographic and homographic puns. Empirical results on the benchmark datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach that the two tasks of pun detection and location can be addressed by a single model from a sequence labeling perspective.",
