The term vectors for a document collection can be organized into a term by document co-occurrence matrix. When directly using these representations, synonyms and polysemous terms, that is, terms with multiple senses or meanings, are not handled well. Methods for smoothing the term distributions through the use of latent classes have been shown to improve the performance of a number of information access tasks, including retrieval over smaller collections (Deerwester et al., 1990 ), text segmentation (Brants et al., 2002) , and text classification (Wu and Gunopulos, 2002) .",

The standard method for maximum likelihood estimation is the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. For a given initialization, the likelihood function increases with EM iterations until a local maximum is reached, rather than a global maximum, so that the quality of the solution depends on the initialization of the model. Additionally, the likelihood values across different initializations are not comparable, as we will show. Thus, the likelihood function computed over the training data cannot be used as a predictor of model performance across different models.",

We will present a framework for using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) to better initialize the parameters of a corresponding PLSA model. The EM algorithm is then used to further refine the initial estimate. This combination of LSA and PLSA leverages the advantages of both. This paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we review related work in the area. In section 3, we summarize related work on LSA and its probabilistic interpretation. In section 4 we review the PLSA model and in section 5 we present our method for initializing a PLSA model using LSA model parameters. In section 6, we evaluate the performance of our framework on a text segmentation task and several smaller information retrieval tasks. And in section 7, we summarize our results and give directions for future work.",

These include the use of Tempered EM (Hofmann, 1999) , combining models from different initializations in postprocessing (Hofmann, 1999; Brants et al., 2002) , and trying to find good initial values. For their segmentation task, Brants et al. (2002) found overfitting, which Tempered EM helps address, was not a problem and that early stopping of EM provided good performance and faster learning. Computing and combining different models is computationally expensive, so a method that reduces this cost is desirable. Different methods for initializing EM include the use of random initialization e.g., (Hofmann, 1999) , k-means clustering, and an initial cluster refinement algorithm (Fayyad et al., 1998) . K-means clustering is not a good fit to the PLSA model in several ways: it is sensitive to outliers, it is a hard clustering, and the relation of the identified clusters to the PLSA parameters is not well defined. In contrast to these other initialization methods, we know that the LSA reduces noise in the data and handles synonymy, and so should be a good initialization. The trick is in trying to relate the LSA parameters to the PLSA parameters.",

It has been successfully applied in different domains including automatic indexing. Text similarity is better estimated in this low dimension space because synonyms are mapped to nearby locations and noise is reduced, although handling of polysemy is weak. In contrast, the PLSA model distributes the probability mass of a term over the different latent classes correspond-ing to different senses of a word, and thus better handles polysemy (Hofmann, 1999) . The LSA model has two additional desirable features. First, the word document co-occurrence matrix can be weighted by any weight function that reflects the relative importance of individual words (e.g., tfidf). The weighting can therefore incorporate external knowledge into the model. Second, the SVD algorithm is guaranteed to produce the matrix of rank that minimizes the distance to the original word document co-occurrence matrix.",

We evaluated the retrieval results (at the 11 standard recall levels as well as the average precision and break-even precision) using manually tagged relevance. Figure 1 shows the average precision as a function of the number of latent classes for the CACM collection, the largest of the datasets. The LSA-PLSA model performance was better than both the LSA performance and the PLSA performance at all class sizes. This same general trend was observed for the CISI dataset. For the two smallest datasets, the LSA-PLSA model performed better than the randomly-initialized PLSA model at all class sizes; it performed better than the LSA model at the larger classes sizes where the best performance is obtained. In Table 2 the performance for each model using the optimal number of latent classes is shown. The results show that LSA-PLSA outperforms LSA on 7 out of 8 evaluations. LSA-PLSA outperforms both random and k-means initialization of PLSA in all evaluations. In addition, performance using random initialization was never worse than kmeans initialization, which itself is sensitive to initialization values. Thus in the rest of our experiments we initialized PLSA models using the simpler random-initialization instead of k-means initialization. ",

We also compared these models against the performance of an averaged model without an LSA-PLSA model: 1 LSA and 1 PLSA model. In each case, the PLSA models were randomly initialized. Figure 2 shows the average precision as a function of the number of latent classes for the CISI collection using multiple models. In all class sizes, a combined model that included the LSAinitialized PLSA model had performance that was at least as good as using 4 PLSA models. This was also true for the CRAN dataset. For the other two datasets, the performance of the combined model was always better than the performance of 4 PLSA models when the number of factors was no more than 200-300, the region where the best performance was observed.",
