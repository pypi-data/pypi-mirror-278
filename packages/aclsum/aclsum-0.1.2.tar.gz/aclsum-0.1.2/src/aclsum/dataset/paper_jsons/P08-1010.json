                "text": "Phrase has become the standard basic translation unit in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) since it naturally captures context dependency and models internal word reordering. In a phrase-based SMT system, the phrase translation table is the defining component which specifies alternative translations and their probabilities for a given source phrase. In learning such a table from parallel corpus, two related issues need to be addressed (either separately or jointly): which pairs are considered valid translations and how to assign weights, such as probabilities, to them. The first problem is referred to as phrase pair extraction, which identifies phrase pairs that are supposed to be translations of each other. Methods have been proposed, based on syntax, that take advantage of linguistic constraints and alignment of grammatical structure, such as in Yamada and Knight (2001) and Wu (1995) . The most widely used approach derives phrase pairs from word alignment matrix (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003) . Other methods do not depend on word alignments only, such as directly modeling phrase alignment in a joint generative way (Marcu and Wong, 2002) , pursuing information extraction perspective (Venugopal et al., 2003) , or augmenting with modelbased phrase pair posterior (Deng and Byrne, 2005) .",

As in information retrieval, precision and recall issues need to be addressed with a right balance for building a phrase translation table. High precision requires that identified translation candidates are accurate, while high recall wants as much valid phrase pairs as possible to be extracted, which is important and necessary for online translation that requires coverage. In the word-alignment derived phrase extraction approach, precision can be improved by filtering out most of the entries by using a statistical significance test (Johnson et al., 2007) . On the other hand, there are valid translation pairs in the training corpus that are not learned due to word alignment errors as shown in Deng and Byrne (2005) .",

One approach is to leverage underlying word alignment quality such as in Ayan and Dorr (2006) . In this work, we present a generic discriminative phrase pair extraction framework that can integrate multiple features aiming to identify correct phrase translation candidates. A significant deviation from most other approaches is that the framework is parameterized and can be optimized jointly with the decoder to maximize translation performance on a development set. Within the general framework, the main work is on investigating useful metrics. We employ features based on word alignment models and alignment matrix. We also propose information metrics that are derived from both bilingual and monolingual perspectives. All these features are data-driven and independent of languages. The proposed phrase extraction framework is general to apply linguistic features such as semantic, POS tags and syntactic dependency.",

We propose several information metrics derived from posterior distribution, language model and word alignments as feature functions. The ViterbiExtract is a special case where a single binary feature function defined from word alignments is used. Its good performance (as shown in Table 3 ) suggests that word alignments are very indicative of phrase pair quality. So we design comparative experiments to capture word alignment impact only. We start with basic features that include model-based posterior, bilingual and monolingual information metrics. Its results on different test sets are presented in the \"basic\" row of Table 4 . We add word alignment feature (\"+align\" row), and then apply bilinear transform to the consistency ratio WPPCR as described in section 3.4 (\"+align BLT\" row). The parameter controlling the degree of attenuation in BLT is also optimized together with other feature weights.",

With the word alignment based feature WPPCR, we obtain a 2% improvement on 04test set but not much on other sets except slight degradation on 06test. Finally, applying BLT transform to WPPCR leads to additional 0.8 BLEU point on 06dev set and 1.2 point on 06test set. This confirms the effectiveness of word alignment based features. Now we compare the phrase table using the proposed method to that extracted using the baseline ViterbiExtract method with Model-4 word alignments. The Venn diagram in Table 5 shows how the two phrase tables overlap with each other and size of each part. As expected, they have a large number of common phrase pairs (PP2). The new method is able to extract more phrase pairs than the baseline with Model-4. PP1 is the set of phrase pairs found by Model-4 alignments. Removing PP1 from the baseline phrase table (comparing the first group of scores) or adding PP1 to the new phrase table (the second group of scores) overall results in no or marginal performance change. On the other hand, adding phrase pairs extracted by the new method only (PP3) can lead to significant BLEU score increases (comparing row 1 vs. 3, and row 2 vs. 4).",
