It includes dialog-based (both voice and online chat) and email support a user receives from a professional agent. Call centers have become a central focus of most companies as they allow them to be in direct contact with their customers to solve product-related and servicesrelated issues and also for grievance redress. A typical call center agent handles over a hundred calls in a day. Gigabytes of data is produced every day in the form of speech audio, speech transcripts, email, etc. This data is valuable for doing analysis at many levels, e.g., to obtain statistics about the type of problems and issues associated with different products and services. This data can also be used to evaluate agents and train them to improve their performance.",

To analyze the calls in any domain, analysts need to identify the key issues in the domain. Further, there may be variations within a domain, say mobile phones, based on the service providers. The analysts generate a domain model through inspection of the call records (audio, transcripts and emails). Such a model can include a listing of the call categories, types of problems solved in each category, listing of the customer issues, typical questions-answers, appropriate call opening and closing styles, etc. In essence, these models provide a structured view of the domain. Manually building such models for various domains may become prohibitively resource intensive. Another important point to note is that these models are dynamic in nature and change over time. As a new version of a mobile phone is introduced, software is launched in a country, a sudden attack of a virus, the model may need to be refined. Hence, an automated way of creating and maintaining such a model is important.",

Current automatic speech recognition technology for telephone calls have moderate to high word error rates (Padmanabhan et al., 2002) . We applied various feature engineering techniques to combat the noise introduced by the speech recognition system and applied text clustering techniques to group topically similar calls together. Using clustering at different granularity and identifying the relationship between groups at different granularity we generate a taxonomy of call types. This taxonomy is augmented with various meta information related to each node as mentioned above. Such a model can be used for identification of topics of unseen calls. Towards this, we envision an aiding tool for agents to increase agent effectiveness and an administrative tool for agent appraisal and training.",

                "text": "In this work, we are trying to bridge the gap between a few seemingly unrelated research areas viz. (1) Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), (2) Text Clustering and Automatic Taxonomy Generation (ATG) and (3) Call Center Analytics. We present some relevant work done in each of these areas. Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR): Automatic transcription of telephonic conversations is proven to be more difficult than the transcription of read speech. According to (Padmanabhan et al., 2002) , word-error rates are in the range of 7-8% for read speech whereas for telephonic speech it is more than 30%. This degradation is due to the spontaneity of speech as well as the telephone channel. Most speech recognition systems perform well when trained for a particular accent (Lawson et al., 2003) . However, with call centers now being located in different parts of the world, the requirement of handling different ac-cents by the same speech recognition system further increases word error rates. Automatic Taxonomy Generation (ATG): In recent years there has been some work relating to mining domain specific documents to build an ontology. Mostly these systems rely on parsing (both shallow and deep) to extract relationships between key concepts within the domain. The ontology is constructed from this by linking the extracted concepts and relations (Jiang and Tan, 2005) . However, the documents contain well formed sentences which allow for parsers to be used. Call Center Analytics: A lot of work on automatic call type classification for the purpose of categorizing calls (Tang et al., 2003) , call routing (Kuo and Lee, 2003; Haffner et al., 2003) , obtaining call log summaries (Douglas et al., 2005) , agent assisting and monitoring (Mishne et al., 2005) has appeared in the past. In some cases, they have modeled these as text classification problems where topic labels are manually obtained (Tang et al., 2003) and used to put the calls into different buckets. Extraction of key phrases, which can be used as features, from the noisy transcribed calls is an important issue. For manually transcribed calls, which do not have any noise, in (Mishne et al., 2005) a phrase level significance estimate is obtained by combining word level estimates that were computed by comparing the frequency of a word in a domain-specific corpus to its frequency in an open-domain corpus. In (Wright et al., 1997) phrase level significance was obtained for noisy transcribed data where the phrases are clustered and combined into finite state machines. Other approaches use n-gram features with stop word removal and minimum support (Kuo and Lee, 2003; Douglas et al., 2005) . In (Bechet et al., 2004 ) call center dialogs have been clustered to learn about dialog traces that are similar. Our Contribution: In the call center scenario, the authors are not aware of any work that deals with automatically generating a taxonomy from transcribed calls. In this paper, we have tried to formalize the essential aspects of a domain model. We show an unsupervised method for building a domain model from noisy unlabeled data, which is available in abundance. This hierarchical domain model contains summarized topic specific details for topics of different granularity. We show how such a model can be used for topic identification of unseen calls. We propose two applications for aiding agents while handling calls and for agent monitoring based on the domain model.",

The transcription server, used for transcribing the call center data, is an IBM research prototype. The speech recognition system was trained on 300 hours of data comprising of help desk calls sampled at 6KHz. The transcription output comprises information about the recognized words along with their durations, i.e., beginning and ending times of the words. Further, speaker turns are marked, so the agent and customer portions of speech are demarcated without exactly naming which part is the agent and which the customer. It should be noted that the call center agents and the customers were of different nationalities having varied accents and this further made the job of the speech recognizer hard. The resultant transcriptions have a word error rate of about 40%. This high error rate implies that many wrong deletions of actual words and wrong insertion of dictionary words have taken place. Also often speaker turns are not correctly identified and voice portions of both speakers are assigned to a single speaker. Apart from speech recognition errors there are other issues related to spontaneous speech recognition in the transcriptions. There are no punctuation marks, silence periods are marked but it is not possible to find sentence boundaries based on these. There are repeats, false starts, a lot of pause filling words such as um and uh, etc. Portion of a transcribed call is shown in figure 1 . Generally, at these noise levels such data is hard to interpret by a human. We used over 2000 calls that have been automatically transcribed for our analysis.

Hence, we used the default repeated bisection technique with cosine function as the similarity metric. We ran this algorithm on a collection of 2000 transcriptions multiple times. First we generate 5 clusters from the 2000 transcriptions. Next we generate 10 clusters from the same set of transcriptions and so on. At the finest level we split them into 100 clusters. To generate the topic taxonomy, these sets containing 5 to 100 clusters are passed through the Taxonomy Builder component. This component (1) removes clusters containing less than n documents (2) introduces directed edges from cluster v 1 to v 2 if v 1 and v 2 share at least one document between them, and where v 2 is one level finer than v 1 .

We observed that call durations and number of speaker turns varies significantly from one topic to another. Figure 5 shows average call duration and corresponding average transcription lengths for a few interesting topics. It can be seen that in topic cluster-1, which is about expense reimbursement and related stuff, most of the queries can be answered quickly in standard ways. However, some connection related issues (topic cluster-5) require more information from customers and are generally longer in duration. Interestingly, topic cluster-2 and topic cluster-4 have similar average call durations but quite different average transcription lengths. On investigation we found that cluster-4 is primarily about printer related queries where the customer many a times is not ready with details like printer name, ip address of the printer, resulting in long hold time whereas for cluster-2, which is about online courses, users We build a hierarchical index of type {topic\u2192information} based on this automatically generated model for each topic in the topic taxonomy. An entry of this index contains topic specific information viz. (1) typical Q&As, (2) typical actions, and (3) call statistics. As we go down this hierarchical index the information associated with each topic becomes more and more specific. In (Mishne et al., 2005) a manually developed collection of issues and their solutions is indexed so that they can be matched to the call topic. In our work the indexed collection is automatically obtained from the call transcriptions. Also, our index is more useful because of its hierarchical nature where information can be obtained for topics of various granularity unlike (Mishne et al., 2005) where there is no concept of topics at all.",

By interacting further with the customer the agent identifies it to be of {copi archiv replic} topic and typical Q&As and actions change accordingly. Finally, the agent narrows down to the topic as {servercopi localcopi} and suggest solution for replication problem in Lotus Notes.",

We envision this post-processing tool to be used for comparing completed individual calls with corresponding topics based on the distribution of Q&As, actions and call statistics. Based on the topic level information we can check whether the agent identified the issues and offered the known solutions on a given topic. We can use the dialog level information to check whether the agent used courteous opening and closing sentences. Calls that deviate from the topic specific distributions, can be identified in this way and agents handling these calls can be offered further training on the subject matter, courtesy, etc. This kind of postprocessing tool can also help us to catch abnormally long calls, agents with high average call handle time, etc.",
