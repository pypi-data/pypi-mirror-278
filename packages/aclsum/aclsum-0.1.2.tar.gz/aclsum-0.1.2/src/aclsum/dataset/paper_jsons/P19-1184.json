    "abstract": "This paper introduces the PhotoBook dataset, a large-scale collection of visually-grounded, task-oriented dialogues in English designed to investigate shared dialogue history accumulating during conversation. Taking inspiration from seminal work on dialogue analysis, we propose a data-collection task formulated as a collaborative game prompting two online participants to refer to images utilising both their visual context as well as previously established referring expressions. We provide a detailed description of the task setup and a thorough analysis of the 2,500 dialogues collected. To further illustrate the novel features of the dataset, we propose a baseline model for reference resolution which uses a simple method to take into account shared information accumulated in a reference chain. Our results show that this information is particularly important to resolve later descriptions and underline the need to develop more sophisticated models of common ground in dialogue interaction. 1 ",

This common ground (Stalnaker, 1978) then is used to optimise understanding and communication efficiency. Equipping artificial dialogue agents with a similar representation of dialogue context thus is a pivotal next step in improving the quality of their dialogue output.",

This setup takes inspiration from experimental paradigms extensively used within the psycholinguistics literature to investigate partnerspecific common ground (for an overview, see Brown-Schmidt et al., 2015) , adapting them to the requirements imposed by online crowdsourcing methods. The task is formulated as a game consisting of five rounds. Figure 1 shows an example of a participant's display. Over the five rounds of a game, a selection of previously displayed images will be visible again, prompting participants to re-refer to images utilising both their visual context as well as previously established referring expressions. The resulting dialogue data therefore allows for tracking the common ground developing between dialogue participants.",

With referring expressions and messages in general getting shorter, content words thus appear to be favoured to remain. We also observe that participants reuse these content words. Figure 2c shows the number of novel content tokens per game round, which roughly follows a negative logarithmic function. This supports the hypothesis of participants establishing a conceptual pact on the referring expression attached to a specific referent: Once accepted, a referring expression is typically refined through shortening rather than by reformulating or adding novel information (cf., Brennan and Clark, 1996) .",

The case of adverbs, which show a 12% relative increase, is particular: Manual examination showed that most adverbs are not used to described images but rather to flag that a given image has already appeared before or to confirm/reject ('again' and 'too' make up 21% of all adverb occurrences; about 36% are 'not', 'n't' and 'yes'). These results indicate that interlocutors are most likely to retain the nouns and adjectives of a developing referring expression, while increasingly dropping verbs, as well as prepositions and determiners. A special role here takes definite determiner 'the', which, in spite of the stark decline of determiners in general, increases by 13% in absolute occurrence counts between the first and last round of a game, suggesting a shift towards known information.",

(2018) find that the pragmatics of goal-oriented dialogue leads to consistently more factual scene descriptions and reasonable referring expressions than traditional, context-free labelling of the same images. We argue that in the PhotoBook task referring expressions are not only adapted based on the goal-oriented nature of the interaction but also by incorporating the developing common ground between the participants. This effect becomes most apparent when collecting all referring expressions for a specific target image produced during the different rounds of a game in its coreference chain. Before filtering, first referring expressions do not significantly differ in length from the COCO captions. Last descriptions however are significantly shorter than both the COCO captions and first descriptions. After filtering for content words, no significant differences remain. We also calculate the cosine distance between the three different descriptions based on their average word vectors. 6Non-function words here should not significantly alter an utterance's mean word vector, which is confirmed in our results. Before as well as after filtering, the distance between last referring expression and COCO captions is almost double the distance between the first referring expressions and the captions (see last column in Table 1 ). Comparing the distribution of word classes in the captions and referring expressions finally revealed a similar distribution in first referring expressions and COCO captions, and a significantly different distribution in last referring expressions, among other things doubling the relative frequency of nouns.",

The results show that the resolution capabilities of our model are well above the baseline. The HISTORY model achieves higher recall and F-score than the NO-HISTORY model, while precision is comparable across these two conditions. For a more in-depth analysis of the results, we examine how precision and recall vary depending on the position of the to-be-resolved segment within a reference chain. Figure 4 displays this information. As hypothesised, we observe that resolution performance is lower for later segments in a reference chain. For example, while precision is close to 60% for first mentions (position 1 in a chain), it declines by around 20 points for last mentions. The plots in Figure 4 also show the impact of taking into account the common ground accumulated over a reference chain. This is most prominent with regard to the recall of target images. The HISTORY model yields higher results than the NO-HISTORY model when it comes to resolving segments that refer to an image that has already been referred to earlier within the dialogue (positions > 1). Yet, the presence of linguistic context does not fully cancel out the effect observed above: The performance of the HISTORY model also declines for later segments in a chain, indicating that more sophisticated methods are needed to fully exploit shared linguistic information.",

Qualitative inspection of the reference chains reveals that this compression process can lead to very nonstandard descriptions. We hypothesise that the degree to which the compressed descriptions rely on visual information has an impact on the performance of the models. For example, the NO-HISTORY model can be effective when the participants converge on a non-standard description which highlights a visual property of the target image that clearly discriminates it from the distractors. This is the case in the example shown on the left-hand side of Figure 5 . The target image shows a woman holding what seems to be a plastic carrot. This feature stands out in a domain where all the candidate images include a person and a TV.8 After an initial, longer description ('a woman sitting in front of a monitor with a dog wallpaper while holding a plastic carrot'), the participants use the much more compact description 'the carrot lady'. Arguably, given the saliency of the carrot in the given context, relying on the preceding linguistic history is not critical in this case, and thus both the NO-HISTORY and the HISTORY model succeed in identifying the target.",

The image and reference chain on the right-hand side of Figure 5 illustrate this point, where the description to be resolved is the remarkably abstract 'strange'. Here the HISTORY model succeeds while the NO-HISTORY model fails. As in the previous example, the referring expression in the first segment of the reference chain for this image ('a strange bike with two visible wheels in the back') includes more descriptive content -indeed, it is similar to a caption, as shown by our analysis in Section 5.3. By exploiting shared linguistic context, the HISTORY model can not only interpret the non-standard phrase, but also recover additional properties of the image not explicit in the segment to be resolved, which presumably help to ground it.",

The collected dialogues exhibit a significant shortening of utterances throughout a game, with final referring expressions starkly differing from both standard image captions and initial descriptions. To illustrate the potential of the dataset, we trained a baseline reference resolution model and showed that information accumulated over a reference chain helps to resolve later descriptions.

The pictures largely are snapshots of everyday situations, placing objects in a natural and often rich context (hence the name Common Objects in COntext) instead of showing an iconic view of objects. In the MS COCO Trainset, images are manually annotated with the outlines of the depicted objects as well as their object categories. We use this information to select similar pictures to display in the PhotoBook task. Through the filtering described in Section 3, we obtained 30 sets of similar images with different pairings of their most prominent objects. In total there are 26 unique object categories in the image sets. The most frequent object category in the image sets is person, which is one of the two main objects in 19 sets.",

Although we do expect that participants get more efficient over time, we argue that this effect is largely related to the fact that participants need to get familiar with the task's mechanics when it is the first time they are exposed to it. In order to control for this effect, we added a warming-up round with three images per participant10 for each pair of new participants (see Figure 8a ). This strongly reduced the completion time of new participants' first game rounds.",

We however also aim at designing the task in such a way that the degree of the partner-specificity in established canonical expressions could be assessed. To achieve this, the participant matching should create settings where a re-entering participant is assigned a game with the same image set as in the game before, but paired with a different conversation partner changes (compare for example Brennan and Clark, 1996) . In order to maximise the number of this second game setting, we encourage workers to continue playing by paying them a bonus of 0.25 USD for each 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th game.",

We want to provide fair payment to workers, which we calculated based on an average wage of 10 USD per hour (Hara et al., 2018). 11 An initial set of runs resulted in an average completion time of 12 minutes, which indicated an expected expense of about 2 USD per participant per game. More experienced workers however managed to complete a full game in six to ten minutes, meaning that for them we would often surpass the 10 USD/h guideline based on this calculation. Other workers -especially new ones -took up to 25 minutes for the first game, which means that they on the other hand would be strongly under-payed with a rigid per-game payment strategy. To mitigate this effect, we developed the following payment schema: Each worker that completes a full game is payed a base-amount of 1.75 USD -which is indicated in the HIT description. If the game took longer than ten minutes, the participants are payed a bonus amount of 0.10 USD per minute, up to an additional bonus payment of 1.50 USD for 25 or more minutes. In order to not encourage workers to play slowly, we only inform them about this bonus at the end of a HIT. With this bonus and the 20% AMT fee on each transaction, we expected an average cost of about 5 USD per game, which due to connection problems in the framework ultimately accumulated to 6 USD for a completed game. The total cost of the data collection, including pilot runs, was 16,350 USD.",

We consider participants' image labelling actions to signal that a previously discussed target image was identified as either common or different and therefore concluding the current dialogue segment. Due to the spontaneous and unrestricted nature of the PhotoBook dialogues, these labelling actions however do not always indicate segment boundaries as cleanly as possible. To improve the quality of extracted dialogue segments and reference chains, we therefore developed a more context-sensitive heuristics to automate segmentation. The heuristics is implemented as a binary decision tree that uses labelling actions as well as any preceding and subsequent messages and additional labelling actions to better decide on segment boundaries and associated target images. It considers 32 combinations of eight different factors. The first case of the heuristics, for example, states that if 1. the current turn is a message, . there is a non-empty, currently developing dialogue segment, then we assume that after one speaker selected an image as common, the other speaker makes one utterance and marks the same image as common, which is resolved by saving the currently developing segment with the common image as referent and initialising a new segment with the trailing utterance of the second speaker. This prevents creating a segment with just the trailing utterance (that cannot be a complete segment) which would be the naive decision if segmenting was based solely on labelling actions. Other cases include whether the next turn is a message by the other participant followed by them labelling a second image as different (likely to indicate that two images were discussed and the segment should be extended by the following message as well as the second target image) or whether none of the preceding and subsequent turns contains labelling actions (indicating an ongoing dialogue segment).",
