While a summary has to give an outline of the text contents, the title has to indicate the subject of the text without revealing all the contents. The process of summarization can use titles, as in (Blais et al., 2007) and (Amini et al., 2005) , thus demonstrating their importance. Automatic summarization provides a set of relevant sentences extracted from the text: The total number of sentences is diminished, but sentences are not shortened by themselves. Ultimately reducing the number to one does not provide a title, since the latter is very rarely a sentence, but needs to be grammatically consistent. It is also necessary to differentiate automatic titling from text compression: Text compression might shorten sentences but keep the original number of sentences (Yousfi-Monod and Prince, 2008) . Mixing both approaches appears as a very costly process to undertake, more adapted to a summarization task, when titling might be obtained by less expansive techniques.",

Once again, the construction of an index can use titles appearing in the document. So, if determining relevant titles is a successful task, the quality of indexation will largely be improved. An automatic titling approach, named POSTIT, extracts relevant noun phrases to be used as titles (Lopez et al., 2011b) . One of its benefits is that long titles, syntactically correct, can be proposed. The main inconvenience is that it cannot provide original titles, using a funny form for example, unless this one already appears in the text (which can be rather scarce, even in newspapers articles). In the same environment, a variant of this approach, called CATIT, constructing short titles, has been developed by the same authors (Lopez et al., 2011a) . It tries to built titles which are relevant to the texts. It evaluates their quality by browsing the Web (popular and recognized expressions), as well as including those titles dynamic context. Applied to a corpus of journalistic articles, CATIT was able to provide headings both informative and catchy. However, syntactical patterns used for titles building were short (two terms) and experience showed that longer titles were often preferred.",

                "text": "If a system were to produce informative, catchy, and variable-sized (in number of words) titles, the nominalization of constituents seems to be an interesting approach. Nominalization is a process transforming an adjective or a verb into a noun or noun phrase. In a nominalized constituent, the time of the event is not in touch with the time of the speech of the event (for example, \"President's departure\" does not infer that the president already left, contrary to \"The president left\"). In some languages such as German and French, nominalization answers an ac-tivity of conceptualization and conciseness. In a title, it allows to focus, according to the context of the author, on the dimension of the event considered the most relevant. (Moirand, 1975) already noticed that in French journalistic articles, numerous titles appear with a nominalized form. This observation was recently confirmed by (Herrero Cecilia, 2007) . It is thus interesting to study automatic titling by nominalization of constituents when dealing with languages where it is often used. In English, the method stays the same, but the pattern changes: English headings patterns incline towards progressive present (e.g. \"Tempest looming\"), an infinitive form with a past participle (e.g. \"Conference to be held\"), and always with a deletion of articles. This paper focuses mostly on French because of its available data, but a shift in languages and patterns is contemplated in a further step.",

Actually the best covering rate of the words of real titles is obtained with these first sentences (see (Baxendale, 1958) , (Vinet, 1993) , (Jacques and Rebeyrolle, 2004) , and (Lopez et al., 2011b) regarding the POSTIT approach), justifying this choice. So, here, the selection of relevant sentences (cf. Step 1.b (cf. Fig. 1 ) consists in labeling these two sentences via SYGFRAN (Chauch\u00e9 and Prince, 2007) , a morphosyntactic parser that tags words. Thus, the presence of a \"auxiliary + past participle\" form syntactic pattern is tested2 (for example, \"a augment\u00e9\" meaning has increased). If such a pattern is recognized in the sentence, then it is retained and goes into the following stages. Otherwise, the sentence is ignored. Then, sentences are pruned according to two heuristics. (Knight and Marcu, 2002) have studied sentence compression by using a noisy-channel model which consists in making the following hypothesis: The sentence to be compressed was formerly short and the author has extended it with additional information (noise). Sentence compression, could, at a first glance, appear as a possible clue, however, our approach does not aim at reducing at most the treated sentence. Indeed, elements which can be pruned to obtain a good summary do not always need to be pruned to obtain a good title. So, the NOMIT sentence pruning step (cf. Fig. 1 , step 1.c) does not only preserve the governors3 . Here, the text is pruned according to three heuristics, inspired from (Yousfi-Monod and Prince, 2008) , focusing on the function and position of constituents in the syntactic tree:",

                "text": "To transpose the agents of a verb into a nominalized constituent, the French language makes a proficient use of prepositions. So when nominalizing \"auxiliary + past participle\" in order to connect it with its complement, the preposition \"de\" (\"of\") is mandatory11 . In English, although \"X of Y\" is an accepted pattern, the genitive form \"Y('s) X\" would be preferred. If the complement does not exist, the subject takes its place. In section 3.1, relative subordinate pronoun and subordinate clauses are eliminated because the information they convey is too secondary to be emphasized in a title. For example, \"My cousin, who lives in Paris, moved\" becomes \"My cousin moved\". So, according to the second rule, the nominalized form will be \"Moving of my cousin\" and not \"Moving of my cousin who lives in Paris\".",

So, if in the treated constituent a single proper noun appears (easily locatable by the presence of a capital letter), the common noun can be put in connection with the nominalized past participle (without concluding that this common noun is an agent of the nominalized verb). This new rule produces titles with the following form: \"Proper noun: verb action + Prep + Complement\". For example, \"S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne returned to Strasburg\" becomes \"S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne: Strasburg comeback\". Section 3.2.1, pointed that several nominalized forms were possible for the same verb. So, the phase of linguistic treatment enables to determine a list of possible noun forms for every constituent. For example, if in step 1 we had \"The restaurant Gazza, situated in a business area, announced a new price\", rule 1 would transform this sentence into two candidates: \"Gazza: New price announcement\" and \"Gazza: New price annunciation\" (queer indeed!).

Based on linguistic and semantic treatments, our approach determines titles among which approximately 80% were evaluated as relevant and more than 60% were qualified as catchy. Experiment and results discussion have pointed at the following liability: The value of Kappa, the inter-judges agreement coefficient, is very difficult to evaluate, mostly when catchiness is at stake. The main cause is that it depends on personal interests. It is thus necessary to ask the following question: Do we have to consider that a title is definitely catchy when at least one person judges it so? Otherwise, how many people at least? This is still an open question and needs to be further investigated. Also, some interesting extensions could be envisaged: The approach presented in this paper uses three rules of transformation based on the presence of an auxiliary followed by a past participle. The addition of new rules would enable a syntactic enrichment of the titles. So, it might be profitable to set up rules taking into account the presence of syntactical patterns (others than \"auxiliary + past participle\") to allow more texts to be titled by NOMIT.",

One of the perspectives can be to track the optimum point between the richness of involved information and processes, and the cost of the method. The incremental methodology followed from POSTIT to NOMIT tends to enhance the belief that parameters (i.e. length, shape, relevance, etc...) for an automatic heading procedure have to be studied and well defined, thus leading to a customized titling process.",
