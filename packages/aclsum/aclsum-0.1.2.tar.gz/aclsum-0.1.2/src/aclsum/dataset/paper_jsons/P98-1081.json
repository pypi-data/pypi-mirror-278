Recent work (e.g. Brill 1992 ) has demonstrated clearly that this categorization is in fact a mix-up of two distinct Categorization systems: on the one hand there is the representation used for the language model (rules, Markov model, neural net, case base, etc.) and on the other hand the manner in which the model is constructed (hand crafted vs. data driven).",

When a data driven method is used, a model is automatically learned from the implicit structure of an annotated training corpus. This is much easier and can quickly lead to a model which produces results with a 'reasonably' good quality.",

Unfortunately, the quality that can be reached for a given task is limited, and not merely by the potential of the learning method used. Other limiting factors are the power of the hard-and software used to implement the learning method and the availability of training material. Because of these limitations, we find that for most tasks we are (at any point in time) faced with a ceiling to the quality that can be reached with any (then) available machine learning system. However, the fact that any given system cannot go beyond this ceiling does not mean that machine learning as a whole is similarly limited. A potential loophole is that each type of learning method brings its own 'inductive bias' to the task and therefore different methods will tend to produce different errors. In this paper, we are concerned with the question whether these differences between models can indeed be exploited to yield a data driven model with superior performance.",

The underlying assumption is twofold. First, the combined votes will make the system more robust to the quirks of each learner's particular bias.

The reasons for this choice are several. First of all, tagging is a widely researched and well-understood task (cf. van Halteren (ed.) 1998). Second, current performance levels on this task still leave room for improvement: 'state of the art' performance for data driven automatic wordclass taggers (tagging English text with single tags from a low detail tagset) is 96-97% correctly tagged words. Finally, a number of rather different methods are available that generate a fully functional tagging system from annotated text.",

Since the component taggers all used n-gram statistics to model context probabilities and the knowledge representation was hence fundamentally the same in each component, the results were limited. Now there are more varied systems available, a variety which we hope will lead to better combination effects. For this experiment we have selected four systems, primarily on the basis of availability. Each of these uses different features of the text to be tagged, and each has a completely different representation of the language model.",

During tagging these rules are applied in sequence to new text. Of all the four systems, this one has access to the most information: contextual information (the words and tags in a window spanning three positions before and after the focus word) as well as lexical information (the existence of words formed by suffix/prefix addition/deletion).
