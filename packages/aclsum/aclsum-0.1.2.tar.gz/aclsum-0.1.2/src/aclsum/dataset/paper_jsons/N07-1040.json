In the genetics domain, for instance, information extraction of genes and gene-protein interactions helps geneticists scan large amounts of information (e.g., as explored in the TREC Genomics track (Hersh et al., 2004) ). Elsewhere, citation indexes (Garfield, 1979) provide bibliometric data about the frequency with which particular papers are cited. The success of citation indexers such as CiteSeer (Giles et al., 1998) and Google Scholar relies on the robust detection of formal citations in arbitrary text. In bibliographic information retrieval, anchor text, i.e., the context of a citation can be used to characterise (index) the cited paper using terms outside of that paper (Bradshaw, 2003) ; O'Connor (1982) presents an approach for identifying the area around citations where the text focuses on that citation. And automatic citation classification (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Teufel et al., 2006) determines the function that a citation plays in the discourse.",

One can estimate how important a citation is by simply counting how often it occurs in the paper. But as Kim and Webber (2006) argue, this ignores many expressions in text which refer to the cited author's work but which are not as easy to recognise as citations. They address the resolution of instances of the third person personal pronoun \"they\" in astronomy papers: it can either refer to a citation or to some entities that are part of research within the paper (e.g., planets or galaxies). Several applications should profit in principle from detecting connections between referring expressions and citations. For instance, in citation function classification, the task is to find out if a citation is described as flawed or as useful. Consider: Most computational models of discourse are based primarily on an analysis of the intentions of the speakers [Cohen and Perrault, 1979 ][Allen and Perrault, 1980 ][Grosz and Sidner, 1986] WEAK . The speaker will form intentions based on his goals and then act on these intentions, producing utterances. The hearer will then reconstruct a model of the speaker's intentions upon hearing the utterance. This approach has many strong points, but does not provide a very satisfactory account of the adherence to discourse conventions in dialogue.",

We use three baselines: As Table 3 shows, our machine learning approach performs much better than the baselines on all the agreement metrics, and is indeed closer to human performance than to any of the baselines. The MUC evaluation appears to produce highly inflated results on our task -when there is a small set of co-reference classes and one of these classes contains 70% of data points, it takes only a small number of missing links to correct annotations. This results in unreasonably high values, particularly for the majority class baseline of labelling every data point as Current-Paper.

In all work to date, classification of sentences into one of the AZ categories has been performed on the basis of features extracted from within the sentence, and a few contextual features such as section heading and location in document. Scientific attribution links previously unresolved noun phrases or pronouns in the sentence to citations. As this provides the machine learner with more information, AZ results should improve.",
