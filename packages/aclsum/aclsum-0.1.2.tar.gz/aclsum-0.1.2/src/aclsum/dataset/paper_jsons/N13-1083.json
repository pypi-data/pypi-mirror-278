They consist of spoken words and phrases that represent self-correction, hesitation, and floor-grabbing behaviors, but do not add semantic information; removing them yields the intended, fluent utterance. The presence of disfluencies in conversational speech data can cause problems for both downstream processing (parsing and other natural language processing tasks) and human readability of speech transcripts. There has been much research effort on automatic disfluency detection in recent years (Shriberg and Stolcke, 1997; Snover et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Lin and Lee, 2009; Schuler et al., 2010; Georgila et al., 2010; Zwarts and Johnson, 2011) , particularly from the DARPA EARS (Effective, Affordable, Reusable Speech-to-Text) MDE (MetaData Extraction) (DARPA Information Processing Technology Office, 2003) program, which focused on the automatic transcription of sizable amounts of speech data and rendering such transcripts in readable form, for both conversational telephone speech (CTS) and broadcast news (BN).",

Second, we implement an automatic filled pause detection approach through constrained speech recognition, as presented in Section 3.

Fillers include filled pauses (FP), discourse markers (DM), and explicit editing terms (ET). FPs are words used by the speakers as floor holders to maintain control of a conversation. They can also indicate hesitations of the speaker. In this work, English FPs comprise uh and um, based on English CTS corpora. For Mandarin, Zhao and Jurafsky found that Mandarin speakers intensively used both demonstratives zhege (literally 'this') and nage (literally 'that') and uh/mm as FPs based on a large speech corpus of Mandarin telephone conversation (Zhao and Jurafsky, 2005) . We study the same set of Chinese FPs in this study. DMs are words or phrases related to the structure of the discourse and help taking or keeping a turn, or serving as acknowledgment, for example, I mean, you know. An explicit ET is an editing term in an edit disfluency that is not an FP or a DM. For example, we have two action items sorry three action items from the meeting, where sorry is an explicit ET.",

The basic pattern for edit disfluencies has the form (reparandum) <editing term> correction. The reparandum is the portion of the utterance that is corrected or abandoned entirely (in the case of restarts). An interruption point (IP), marked with ' ' in the pattern, is the point at which the speaker breaks off the original utterance and then repeats, revises, or restarts the utterance. The editing term is optional and consists of one or more filler words. The correction is the portion of the utterance that corrects the original reparandum. Revisions denote the cases when a speaker modifies the original utterance with a similar syntactic structure, e.g., we have two action items sorry three action items from the meeting. Restarts denote the cases when a speaker abandons an utterance or a constituent and restarts all over again, e.g., He I like this idea.",

                "text": "We used a CRF model to combine lexical features, shallow syntactic features, and prosodic features for joint detection of edit words and IP words. A CRF defines a global log-linear distribution of the state (or label) sequence E conditioned on an observation sequence, in our case including the word sequence W and the features F , and optimized globally over the entire sequence considering the context event information for making decisions at each point. We used the Mallet package (McCallum, 2002) to implement the CRF model. We used a first-order model that includes only two sequential events in the feature set. The CRF model is trained to maximize the conditional log-likelihood of a given training set P (EjW; F ). During testing, the most likely sequence E is found using the Viterbi algorithm. To avoid over-fitting, a zero-mean Gaussian prior (Mc-Callum and Li, 2003) was applied to the parameters, where the variance of the prior was optimized on the development test set. Each word is associated with a class label, representing whether it is an edit word or not. We included IP in the target classes and used five states, as outside edit (O), begin edit with an IP (B-E+IP), begin edit (B-E), inside edit with an IP (I-E+IP), and inside edit (I-E) (Liu et al., 2006) . State transitions are also the same as in (Liu et al., 2006) . We built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based part-of-speech (POS) taggers for English conversational speech and Mandarin broadcast conversation data. After employing the co-training approach described in (Wang et al., 2007) , we achieved 94% POS tagging accuracy for both data sets. The features for CRF modeling include: n-grams from words and automatically generated POS tags, speaker turns, whether there is a repeated word sequence ending at a word boundary, whether a word is a fragment, whether there is a predefined filler phrase after the word boundary, and the prosody model posterior probabilities from a decision tree model (Shriberg and Stolcke, 1997) and discretized by cumulative binning (Liu et al., 2006) . The prosodic features were computed for each interword boundary from words and phonetic alignments of the manual transcriptions. We extracted the same set of prosodic features for English and Mandarin data, based on duration, fundamental frequency (f0), energy, and pause information, and nonprosodic information such as speaker gender and speaker change, for training and applying the decision-tree-based prosody model (Liu et al., 2006) .",

                "text": "We also propose an alternative approach for automatic detection of FPs given speech transcripts that omit FPs but are otherwise accurate. This approach is motivated by situations where only an edited, \"cleaned-up\" transcript is available, but where an accurate verbatim transcript is to be recovered automatically. We treat this task as a constrained speech recognition problem, and investigate how effectively it is solved by a state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system. Hence, this approach can be considered as combining LVCSR acoustic model (AM) and language model (LM) knowledge sources in a search framework for FP detection. Compared to the FP detection component in the disfluency detection systems described in Section 2, this alternative approach explores different knowledge sources. In particular, the AMs explore different front-end features compared to the lexical and prosodic features explored in those disfluency detection systems presented in Section 2. Details of the front-end features are illustrated below. We evaluated this approach on both English and Mandarin conversational speech. For detecting FPs in English conversational speech, we used a modified and simplified form of the recognition system developed for the 2004 NIST Rich Transcription Conversational Telephone Speech (CTS) evaluations, described in (Stolcke et al., 2006) . The first pass of the recognizer uses a within-word MFCC+MLP model (i.e, trained on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features augmented with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based phoneposterior features), while the second pass uses a cross-word model trained on Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) features adapted (by speaker) to the output of the first pass. For purposes of FP detection, the recognition is constrained to a word lattice formed by the manually transcribed non-FP reference words, with optional FP words inserted between any two words and at the beginning and end of each utterance. Both first and second pass decoding was constrained by the optional-FP lattices. In the second pass, HTK lattices were generated with bigram LM probabilities and rescored with a 4-gram LM. The consensus decoding output from the rescored lattices was used for scoring FP detection. The system thus evaluates the posterior probability of an FP at every word boundary using both acoustic model (AM) and language model (LM) evidence. The acoustic model for the English recognition system was trained on about 2300 hours of CTS data. The language models (which models FP like any other word) are bigram and 4-gram statistical word n-gram LMs estimated from the same data plus additional non-CTS data and web data.",

The system conducted a constrained decoding on the optional-FP lattices, using a speaker-independent within-word triphone MPEtrained MFCC+pitch+MLP model and a pruned trigram LM. For the Mandarin ASR system, the MFCC+MLP front-end features were augmented with 3-dimension smoothed pitch features (Lei et al., 2006) . HTK lattices were generated with probabilities from the pruned trigram LM and rescored by the full trigram LM. The consensus decoding output from the rescored lattices was used for scoring FP detection. The AMs for this system were trained on 1642 hours of Mandarin broadcast news and conversation speech data and the LMs were trained on 1.4 billion words comprising a variety of resources. Details of training data and system development were illustrated in (Lei et al., 2009) .",

Both Finke et al.'s approach (Finke and Waibel, 1997) and our approach built a lattice from each transcription sentence (in our approach, optional filled pauses are inserted between any two words and at the beginning and end of each utterance). Then Finke et al. force-aligned the lattice with utterance; whereas, we used multi-pass constrained decoding with within-word and cross-word models, MLLR adaptation of the acoustic models, and rescoring with a higher-order n-gram LM, so the performance will be better than just flexible alignment to the lattices. Note that when constructing the word lattices with optional FP words, for En-glish, the optional FP words are a choice between uh and um. For Mandarin, the optional FP words are a choice between uh, mm, zhege, and nage. We assigned equal weights to FP words.",

We randomly held out two 3-hour subsets from this training data set for evaluation and parameter tuning respectively, and used the remaining data for training.

We observe that adding POS features improves edit word, edit IP, and filler word detection for both languages, and adding a prosody model produced further improvement (note that filler word detection systems did not employ prosodic features). The gains from combining the word, POS, and prosody model over the word n-gram baseline are statistically significant for both languages (confidence level p < 0:05 using matched pair test). Also, adding the prosody model over word+POS yielded a larger relative gain in edit word+IP detection performance for Mandarin than for English data. A preliminary study of these results has shown that the prosody model contributes differently for different types of disfluencies for English and Mandarin conversational speech and we will continue this study in future work. We also plan 1 www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/rt/2004-fall/index.html to investigate the prosodic features considering the special characteristics of edited disfluencies in Mandarin studied in (Lin and Lee, 2009) . For evaluating constrained speech recognition for FP detection, the English test set of conversational speech data and word transcripts is derived from the CTS subset of the NIST 2002 Rich Transcription evaluation. The waveforms were segmented according to utterance boundaries given by the humangenerated transcripts, resulting in 6554 utterance segments with a total duration of 6.8 hours. We then excluded turns that have fewer than five tokens or have two or more FPs in a row (such as 'uh um' and 'uh, uh'), resulting in 3359 segments. This yields the test set from which we computed English FP detection scores. The transcripts of this test set contain 54511 non-FP words and 1394 FPs, transcribed as either uh or um. When evaluating FP detection performance, these two orthographical forms were mapped to a single token type, so recognizing one form as the other is not penalized. The Mandarin test set is the DARPA GALE 2008 Mandarin speechto-text development test set of 1 hour duration. The transcripts of this test set contain 9820 non-FP words and 370 FP words, transcribed as uh, mm, zhege, and nage. We collapsed them to a single token type for FP scoring. We evaluated FP detection performance in terms of both false alarm (incorrect detection) and miss (failed detection) rates, shown in Table 2. We observed that adding pronunciation scores didn't change the P fa and P miss . On the English test set, adding LM scores degraded P miss but im- proved P fa . However, on the Mandarin test set, in- creasing LM weight improved both P miss and P fa , suggesting that for the Mandarin LVCSR system in this study, the LM could provide complementary information to the AM to discriminate FP and non-FP words.
