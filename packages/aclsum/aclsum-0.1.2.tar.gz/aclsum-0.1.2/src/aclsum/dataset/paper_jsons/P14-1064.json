With large amounts of data, phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007) achieve state-of-the-art results in many typologically diverse language pairs (Bojar et al., 2013) . However, the limiting factor in the success of these techniques is parallel data availability. Even in resource-rich languages, learning reliable translations of multiword phrases is a challenge, and an adequate phrasal inventory is crucial \u21e4 This work was done while the first author was interning at Microsoft Research for effective translation. This problem is exacerbated in the many language pairs for which parallel resources are either limited or nonexistent. While parallel data is generally scarce, monolingual resources exist in abundance and are being created at accelerating rates. Can we use monolingual data to augment the phrasal translations acquired from parallel data?",

Our work introduces a new take on the problem using graphbased semi-supervised learning to acquire translation rules and probabilities by leveraging both monolingual and parallel data resources. On the source side, labeled phrases (those with known translations) are extracted from bilingual corpora, and unlabeled phrases are extracted from monolingual corpora; together they are embedded as nodes in a graph, with the monolingual data determining edge strengths between nodes ( \u00a72.2). Unlike previous work (Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013a; Razmara et al., 2013) , we use higher order n-grams instead of restricting to unigrams, since our approach goes beyond OOV mitigation and can enrich the entire translation model by using evidence from monolingual text. This enhancement alone results in an improvement of almost 1.4 BLEU points. On the target side, phrases initially consisting of translations from the parallel data are selectively expanded with generated candidates ( \u00a72.1), and are embedded in a target graph.",

Otherwise it is called an unlabeled phrase, and our algorithm finds labels (translations) for these unlabeled phrases, with the help of the graph-based representation.

To generate new translation candidates using morphological information, we morphologically segment words into prefixes, stem, and suffixes using linguistic resources. We assume that a morphological analyzer which provides context-independent analysis of word types exists, and implements the functions STEM(f ) and STEM(e) for source and target word types. Based on these functions, source and target sequences of words can be mapped to sequences of stems. The morphological generation step adds to the target graph all target word sequences from the monolingual data that map to the same stem sequence as one of the target phrases occurring in the baseline phrase table.

For a phrase, we look at the p words before and the p words after the phrase, explicitly distinguishing between the two sides, but not distance (i.e., bag of words on each side). Co-occurrence counts for each feature (context word) are accumulated over the monolingual corpus, and these counts are converted to pointwise mutual information (PMI) values, as is standard practice when computing distributional similarities.

Two language pairs were used: Arabic-English and Urdu-English. The Arabic-English evaluation was used to validate the decisions made during the development of our method and also to highlight properties of the technique. With it, in \u00a73.2 we first analyzed the impact of utilizing phrases instead of words and SLP instead of LP; the latter experiment underscores the importance of generated candidates. We also look at how adding morphological knowledge to the generation process can further enrich performance. In \u00a73.3, we then examined the effect of using a very large 5-gram language model training on 7.5 billion English tokens to understand the nature of the improvements in \u00a73.2. The Urdu to English evaluation in \u00a73.4 focuses on how noisy parallel data and completely monolingual (i.e., not even comparable) text can be used for a realistic low-resource language pair, and is evaluated with the larger language model only. We also examine how our approach can learn from noisy parallel data compared to the traditional SMT system. Baseline phrasal systems are used both for comparison and for generating translation candidates for unlabeled phrases as described in \u00a72.1. The baseline is a state-of-the-art phrase-based system; we perform word alignment using a lexicalized hidden Markov model, and then the phrase table is extracted using the grow-diag-final heuristic (Koehn et al., 2003) . The 13 baseline features (2 lexical, 2 phrasal, 5 HRM, and 1 language model, word penalty, phrase length feature and distortion penalty feature) were tuned using MERT (Och, 2003) , which is also used to tune the 4 feature weights introduced by the secondary phrase table (2 lexical and 2 phrasal, other features being shared between the two tables). For all systems, we use a distortion limit of 4. We use case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) to evaluate translation quality.",

Interestingly, biasing away from generated candidates using all the monolingual data (\"LP 2-gram\") performs similarly to using half the monolingual corpora and handling generated candidates properly (\"SLP-HalfMono\"). Additional morphologically generated candidates were added in this experiment as detailed in \u00a72.3.

To answer this question we trained a 5-gram language model on 570M sentences (7.6B tokens), with data from various sources including the Gigaword corpus 7 , WMT and European Parliamentary Proceedings 8 , and web-crawled data from Wikipedia and the web. Only m-best generated candidates from the baseline were considered during generation, along with labeled neighbors' labels. Table 5 presents the results of using this language model. We obtained a robust, 1.43-BLEU point gain, indicating that the addition of the newly induced phrases provided genuine translation improvements that cannot be compensated by the language model effect. Further examination of the differences between the two systems yielded that most of the improvements are due to better bigrams and trigrams, as indicated by the breakdown of the BLEU score precision per n-gram, and primarily leverages higher quality generated candidates from the baseline system. We analyze the output of these systems further in the output analysis section below ( \u00a73.5).",

In the first setup, we get a huge improvement of 4.2 BLEU points (\"SLP+Noisy\") when using the monolingual data and the noisy parallel data for graph construction. Our method obtained much of the gains achieved by the supervised baseline approach that utilizes the noisy parallel data in conjunction with the NIST-provided parallel data (\"Baseline+Noisy\"), but with fewer assumptions on the nature of the corpora (monolingual vs. parallel). Furthermore, despite completely unaligned, non-comparable monolingual text on the Urdu and English sides, and a very large language model, we can still achieve gains in excess of 1.2 BLEU points (\"SLP\") in a difficult evaluation scenario, which shows that the technique adds a genuine translation improvement over and above na\u00efve memorization of n-gram sequences.",

Recent improvements to BLI (Tamura et al., 2012; Irvine and Callison-Burch, 2013b) have contained a graph-based flavor by presenting label propagation-based approaches using a seed lexicon, but evaluation is once again done on top-1 or top-3 accuracy, and the focus is on unigrams.",

As with previous BLI work, these approaches only take into account source-side similarity of words; only moderate gains (and in the latter work, on a subset of language pairs evaluated) are obtained. Additionally, because of our structured propagation algorithm, our approach is better at handling multiple translation candidates and does not need to restrict itself to the top translation. Klementiev et al. (2012) propose a method that utilizes a pre-existing phrase table and a small bilingual lexicon, and performs BLI using monolingual corpora. The operational scope of their approach is limited in that they assume a scenario where unknown phrase pairs are provided (thereby sidestepping the issue of translation candidate generation for completely unknown phrases), and what remains is the estimation of phrasal probabilities. In our case, we obtain the phrase pairs from the graph structure (and therefore indirectly from the monolingual data) and a separate generation step, which plays an important role in good performance of the method. Similarly, Zhang and Zong (2013) present a series of heuristics that are applicable in a fairly narrow setting.",
