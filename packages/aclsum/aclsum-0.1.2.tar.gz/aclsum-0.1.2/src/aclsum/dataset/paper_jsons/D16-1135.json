The first class of approaches use Wikipedia to generate features for NER systems, e.g., (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Radford et al., 2015) . Kazama and Torisawa (2007) try to find the Wikipedia entity for each candidate word sequence and then extract a category label from the first sentence of the Wikipedia entity page. A part-of-speech (POS) tagger is used to extract the category label features in the training and decoding phase. Ratinov and Roth (2009) aggregate several Wikipedia categories into higher-level concept and build a gazetteer on top of it. The two approaches were shown to be able to improve an English NER system. Both approaches, however, are language-dependent because (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007) requires a POS tagger and (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) requires manual category aggregation by inspection of the annotation guidelines and the training set. Radford et al. (2015) assume that document-specific knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia) tags for each document are provided, and they use those tags to build gazetteer type features for improving an English NER system.",

The motivation is that annotating multilingual NER data by human is both expensive and time-consuming. Richman and Schone (2008) utilize the category information of Wikipedia to determine the entity type of an entity based on manually constructed rules (e.g., category phrase \"Living People\" is mapped to entity type PERSON). Such a rule-based entity type mapping is limited both in accuracy and coverage, e.g., (Toral and Muoz, 2006) . Nothman et al. (2013) train a Wikipedia entity type classifier using human-annotated Wikipedia pages. Such a supervised-learning based approach has better accuracy and coverage, e.g., (Dakka and Cucerzan, 2008) . A number of heuristic rules are developed in both works to label the Wikipedia text to create weakly annotated NER training data. The NER systems trained with the weakly annotated data may achieve similar accuracy compared with systems trained with little human-annotated data (e.g., up to 40K tokens as in (Richman and Schone, 2008) ), but they are still significantly worse than well-trained systems (e.g., a drop of 23.9 F 1 score on the CoNLL data and a drop of 19.6 F 1 score on the BBN data as in (Nothman et al., 2013) ).",

The accuracy of the classifier is further improved via self-training. We apply the classifier on all the English Wikipedia pages and construct an English Wikipedia entity type mapping that includes entities with high classification confidence scores. To build multilingual Wikipedia entity type mappings, we generate weakly annotated classifier training data for another language via projection using the inter-language links of Wikipedia.

A natural approach is to use a mapping to create dictionary type features for training an NER system. In addition, we develop several other approaches. The first approach applies an entity type mapping as a decoding constraint for an NER system. The second approach uses a mapping to post-process the output of an NER system. We also design a robust joint approach that combines the decoding constraint approach and the post-processing approach in a smart way. We evaluate the performance of the Wikipediabased approaches on NER systems trained for 6 languages. We find that when a system is well trained (e.g., with 200K to 300K tokens of human-annotated data), the dictionary feature approach achieves the best improvement over the baseline system; while when a system is trained with little human-annotated training data (e.g., 20K to 30K tokens), a more aggressive decoding constraint approach achieves the best improvement. In both scenarios, the Wikipediabased approaches are effective in improving the accuracy on unseen entities, especially when a system is applied to a new domain (3.6 F 1 score improvement on political party articles/English NER) or it is trained with little training data (18.3 F 1 score improvement on Japanese NER).",
