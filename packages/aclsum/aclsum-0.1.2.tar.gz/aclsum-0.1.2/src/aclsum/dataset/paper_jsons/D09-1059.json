The top-performing system in the task (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) applied a very simple reranking scheme by means of a k-best syntactic output, similar to previous attempts (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Toutanova et al., 2005) to improve semantic role labeling performance by using mul-tiple parses. The system by Henderson et al. (2008) extended previous stack-based algorithms for dependency parsing by using two separate stacks to build the syntactic and semantic graphs. Llu\u00eds and M\u00e0rquez (2008) proposed a model that simultaneously predicts syntactic and semantic links, but since its search algorithm could not take the syntactic-semantic interdependencies into account, a pre-parsing step was still needed. In addition, before the CoNLL-2008 shared task there have been a few attempts to jointly learn syntactic and semantic structure; for instance, Merlo and Musillo (2008) appended semantic role labels to the phrase tags in a constituent treebank and applied a conventional constituent parser to predict constituent structure and semantic roles.",

An open structure is created by a procedure LINK that adds a dependency link to connect a right-pointing and a left-pointing closed structure, and a closed structure by a procedure JOIN that joins an open structure with a closed structure. Figure 2 shows schematic illustrations: a LINK operation connects the right-pointing closed structure between s and j with the left-pointing closed structure between j + 1 and e, and a JOIN operation connects an open structure between s and j with a closed structure between j and e. The search algorithm can easily be extended to find the k best parses, not only the best one. In k-best parsing, we maintain a k-best list in every cell in the dynamic programming table. To create the k-best list of derivations for an open structure between the positions s and e, for instance, there are up to |L| \u2022 (e -s) \u2022 k 2 possible combinations to consider if the set of allowed labels is L. The key observation by Huang and Chiang (2005) is to make use of the fact that the lists are sorted. For every position between s and e, we add the best combination to a priority queue, from which we then repeatedly remove the front item. For every item we remove, we add three successors: an item with a next-best left part, an item with a next-best right part, and finally an item with a next-best edge label.",

Secondly, we assumed that every argument of a given predicate word is either a direct dependent of the predicate, one of its ancestors, or a direct dependent of one of its ancestors. This assumption is a simple adaptation of the pruning algorithm by Xue and Palmer (2004) , and it holds for the vast majority of arguments in the CoNLL-2008 data; in the training set, we measured that this covers 99.04% of the arguments of verbs and 97.55% of the argu-2 Since our algorithm needs to know the positions of the predicates, we trained a separate classifier using the LIBLIN-EAR toolkit (Fan et al., 2008) to identify the predicate words. As features for the classifier, we used the words and part-ofspeech tags in a \u00b13 window around the word under consideration. ments of nouns. Figure 4 shows an example of how the SCOPE function works in our case. If a predicate is contained in the right substructure, we find two potential arguments: one at the start of the left substructure, and one more by recursively searching the left structure. While the primary layer is assumed to be projective in Algorithm 3, the syntactic trees in the CoNLL-2008 data have a small number of nonprojective links. We used a pseudo-projective edge label encoding to handle nonprojectivity (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) .",

A beam width k of 4 was used in this experiment. Table 2 shows the results of the evaluation. The table shows the three most important scores computed by the official evaluation script: labeled syntactic dependency accuracy (LAS), labeled semantic dependency F 1 -measure (Sem. F1), and the macro-averaged F 1 -measure, a weighted combination of the syntactic and semantic scores (M. F1). Our result is competitive; we obtain the same macro F1 as the newly published result by Titov et al. (2009) , which is the highest published figure for a joint syntactic-semantic parser so far. Importantly, our system clearly outperforms the system by Llu\u00eds and M\u00e0rquez (2008) , which is the most similar system in problem modeling, but which uses a different search strategy. Since the search procedure is inexact, it is important to quantify roughly how much of a detrimental impact the approximation has on the parsing quality. We studied the influence of the beam width parameter k on the performance of the parser. The results on the development set can be seen in Table 3 . As can be seen, a modest increase in performance can be obtained by increasing the beam width, at the cost of increased parsing time. In addition, to have a rough indication of the impact of search errors on the quality of the parses, we computed the fraction of sentences where the gold-standard parse had a higher score according to the model than the parse returned by the search3 . Table 4 shows the results of this experiment. This suggests that the search errors, although they clearly have an impact, are not the major source of errors, even with small beam widths. To investigate where future optimization efforts should be spent, we used the built-in hprof profiling tool of Java to locate the bottlenecks. Once again, we ran the program on the development set with a beam width of 4, and Table 5 shows the three types of operations where the algorithm spent most of its time. It turns out that 74% of the time was spent on the computation and scoring of interdependency features. To make our algorithm truly useful in practice, we thus need to devise a way to speed up or cache these computations. ",
