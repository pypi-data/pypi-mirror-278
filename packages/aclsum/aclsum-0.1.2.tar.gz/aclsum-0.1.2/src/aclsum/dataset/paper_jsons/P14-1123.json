The state-ofthe art automated scoring system for spontaneous speech (Zechner et al., 2009; Higgins et al., 2011) currently uses measures of fluency and pronunciation (acoustic aspects) to produce scores that are in reasonable agreement with human-rated scores of proficiency. Despite its good performance, there is a need to extend its coverage to higher order aspects of language ability. Fluency and pronunciation may, by themselves, already be good indicators of proficiency in non-native speakers, but from a construct validity perspective1 , it is necessary that an automatic assessment model measure higher-order aspects of language proficiency. Syntactic complexity is one such aspect of proficiency. By \"syntactic complexity\", we mean a learner's ability to use a wide range of sophisticated grammatical structures.",

Validity: a measure should show high discriminative ability between various levels of language proficiency, and the scores produced by the use of this measure should show high agreement with human-assigned scores. 2. Robustness: a measures should be derived automatically and should be robust to errors in the measure generation process. A critical impediment to the robustness constraint in the state-of-the-art is the multi-stage au-tomated process, where errors in the speech recognition stage (the very first stage) affect subsequent stages. Guided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion. We compare and contrast the proposed measure with that found to be optimum in Yoon and Bhat (2012) .",

Informed by studies in second language acquisition and language testing that regard these factors as key determiners of spoken language proficiency, some researchers have focused on the objective measurement of these aspects of spoken language in the context of automatic assessment of language ability. Notable are studies that have focused on assessment of fluency (Cucchiarini et al., 2000; Cucchiarini et al., 2002) , pronunciation (Witt and Young, 1997; Witt, 1999; Franco et al., 1997; Neumeyer et al., 2000) , and intonation (Zechner et al., 2009) .

Automatic recognition of non-native speakers' spontaneous speech is a challenging task as evidenced by the error rate of the state-of-the-art speech recognizer. For instance, Chen and Zechner (2011) reported a 50.5% word error rate (WER) and Yoon and Bhat (2012) reported a 30% WER in the recognition of ESL students' spoken responses. These high error rates at the recognition stage negatively affect the subsequent stages of the speech scoring system in general, and in particular, during a deep syntactic analysis, which operates on a long sequence of words as its context. As a result, measures of grammatical complexity that are closely tied to a correct syntactic analysis are rendered unreliable. Not surprisingly, Chen and Zechner (2011) studied measures of grammatical complexity via syntactic parsing and found that a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.49 between syntactic complexity measures (derived from manual transcriptions) and proficiency scores, was drastically reduced to near nonexistence when the measures were applied to ASR word hypotheses. This suggests that measures that rely on deep syntactic analysis are unreliable in current ASR-based scoring systems for spontaneous speech.",

We illustrate to the contrary, that they are indeed able to capture certain grammatical errors and sophisticated constructions by means of the following instances.

The main assumption was that each score level is characterized by different types of prominent grammatical structures. These representative constructions are gathered from a collection of ESL learners' spoken responses rated for overall proficiency. The syntactic complexity of a test spoken response was estimated based on its similarity to the proficiency groups in the reference corpus with respect to the score-specific constructions.

Consider the presence of a grammar pattern represented by more than one POS bigram. For example, both \"NN-WDT\" and \"WDT-RB\" in Sentence 2 reflect the learner's usage of a relative clause. However, we note that the two bigrams are correlated and including them both results in an over-estimation of their contribution. The VSM set-up has no mechanism to handle correlated features.",

Grammatical expressions that occur frequently in one score level but rarely in other levels can be assumed to be characteristic of a specific score level. Therefore, the more uneven the distribution of a grammatical expression across score classes, the more important that grammatical expression should be as an indicator of a particular score class. However, the simple idf scheme cannot capture this uneven distribution. A pattern that occurs rarely but uniformly across different score groups can get the same weight as a pattern which is unevenly distributed to one score group. Martineau and Finin (2009) observed this weakness of the tf -idf weighting in the domain of sentiment analysis. When using tf -idf weighting to extract words that were strongly associated with positive sentiment in a movie review corpus (they considered each review as a document and a word as a term), it was found that a substantial proportion of words with the highest tf -idf were rare words (e.g., proper nouns) which were not directly associated with the sentiment.",

A classifier is trained in an inductive fashion, using a large corpus of learner responses that is divided into proficiency scores as the training data and then used to test data that is similar to the training data. A distinguishing feature of the current study is that the measure is based on a comparison of characteristics of the test response to models trained on large amounts of data from each score point, as opposed to measures that are simply characteristics of the responses themselves (which is how measures have been considered in prior studies).",

The productive feature engineering aspects of incorporating features into the discriminative MaxEnt classifier motivate the model choice for the problem at hand. In particular, the ability of the MaxEnt model's estimation routine to handle overlapping (correlated) features makes it directly applicable to address the first limitation of the VSM model. The second limitation, related to the ineffective weighting of terms via the the tf -idf scheme, seems to be addressed by the fact that the MaxEnt model assigns a weight to each feature (in our case, POS bigrams) on a per-class basis (in our case, score group), by taking every instance into consideration. Therefore, a MaxEnt model has an advantage over the model described in 4.1 in that it uses four different weight schemes (one per score level) and each scheme is optimized for each score level. This is beneficial in situations where the features are not evenly important across all score levels.",

However, when considered in the context of language acquisition studies, this approach seems to be justified. Studies in native language acquisition, have considered multiple grammatical developmental indices that represent the grammatical levels reached at various stages of language acquisition. For instance, Covington et al. (2006) proposed the revised D-level scale which was originally studied by Rosenberg and Abbeduto (1987) . The D-Level Scale categorizes grammatical development into 8 levels according to the presence of a set of diverse grammatical expressions varying in difficulty (for example, level 0 consists of simple sentences, while level 5 consists of sentences joined by a subordinating conjunction). Similarly, Scarborough (1990) proposed the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), according to which, the presence of particular grammatical structures, from a list of 60 structures (ranging from simple ones such as including only subjects and verbs, to more complex constructions such as conjoined sentences) is evidence of language acquisition milestones.",
