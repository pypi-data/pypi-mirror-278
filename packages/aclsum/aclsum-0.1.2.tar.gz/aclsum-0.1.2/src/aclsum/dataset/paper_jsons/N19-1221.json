This phenomenon is known as homophily: i.e., people, both in real life and online, tend to cluster with those who appear similar to themselves. To model homophily, recent research in abusive language detection on Twitter (Mishra et al., 2018a) incorporates embeddings for authors (i.e., users who have composed tweets) that encode the structure of their surrounding communities. The embeddings (called author profiles) are generated by applying a node embedding framework to an undirected unlabeled community graph where nodes denote the authors and edges the follower-following relationships amongst them on Twitter. However, these profiles do not capture the linguistic behavior of the authors and their communities and do not convey whether their tweets tend to be abusive or not.",

To generate richer author profiles, we then propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) applied to the heterogeneous graph representation.

Several works have since utilized (deep) neural architectures to achieve impressive results on a variety of abuse-annotated datasets (Nobata et al., 2016; Pavlopoulos et al., 2017a) . Recently, the research focus has shifted towards extraction of features that capture behavioral and social traits of users. Pavlopoulos et al.

The framework utilizes two different strategies for sampling neighbor sets of nodes: Depth-First Sampling (DFS) and Breadth-First Sampling (BFS). The former captures the structural role of nodes, while the latter captures the local neighborhood around them. Two hyper-parameters control the overall contribution of each of these strategies. Following Mishra et al. (2018a) , we initialize these parameters to their default value of 1 and set the embedding size and number of iterations to 200 and 25 respectively. Since node2vec cannot produce embeddings for nodes without edges, we map the solitary authors to a single zero embedding as done by Mishra et al. Graph convolutional networks. We propose an approach for learning author profiles using GCNs applied to the extended graph. In contrast to node2vec, our method allows us to additionally propagate information with respect to whether tweets composed by authors and their communities are abusive or not. Specifically, as labels are available for a subset of nodes in our graph (i.e., the tweet nodes), we frame the task as a graphbased semi-supervised learning problem, allowing the model to distribute gradient information from the supervised loss on the labeled tweet nodes. This, in turn, allows us to create profiles for authors that not only capture the structural traits of their surrounding community but also their own linguistic behavior based on the types of tweets that they have composed.",
