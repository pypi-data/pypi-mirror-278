To this end, we propose an extension of the MS-COCO dataset, FOIL-COCO, which associates images with both correct and 'foil' captions, that is, descriptions of the image that are highly similar to the original ones, but contain one single mistake ('foil word'). We show that current LaVi models fall into the traps of this data and perform badly on three tasks: a) caption classification (correct vs. foil); b) foil word detection; c) foil word correction. Humans, in contrast, have near-perfect performance on those tasks. We demonstrate that merely utilising language cues is not enough to model FOIL-COCO and that it challenges the state-of-the-art by requiring a fine-grained understanding of the relation between text and image.",

                "text": "So far, the primary testbeds of Language and Vision (LaVi) models have been 'Visual Question Answering' (VQA) (e.g. Antol et al. (2015) ; Malinowski and Fritz (2014) ; Malinowski et al. (2015) ; Gao et al. (2015) ; Ren et al. (2015) ) and 'Image Captioning' (IC) (e.g. Hodosh et al. (2013) ; Fang et al. (2015) ; Chen and Lawrence Zitnick (2015) ; Donahue et al. (2015) ; Karpathy and Fei-Fei (2015) ; Vinyals et al. (2015) ). Whilst some models have seemed extremely successful on those tasks, it remains unclear how the reported results should be interpreted and what those Figure 1 : Is the caption correct or foil (T1)? If it is foil, where is the mistake (T2) and which is the word to correct the foil one (T3)? models are actually learning. There is an emerging feeling in the community that the VQA task should be revisited, especially as many current dataset can be handled by 'blind' models which use language input only, or by simple concatenation of language and vision features (Agrawal et al., 2016; Jabri et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Goyal et al., 2016a) . In IC too, Hodosh and Hockenmaier (2016) showed that, contrarily to what prior research had suggested, the task is far from been solved, since IC models are not able to distinguish between a correct and incorrect caption.",

We will refer to it as FOIL-COCO. We evaluate two state-of-the-art VQA models: the popular one by Antol et al. (2015) , and the attention-based model by Lu et al. (2016) , and one popular IC model by (Wang et al., 2016) . We show that those models perform close to chance level, while humans can perform the tasks accurately (Section 4). Section 5 provides an analysis of our results, allowing us to diagnose three failures of LaVi models. First, their coarse representations of language and visual input do not encode suitably structured information to spot mismatches between an utterance and the corresponding scene (tested by T1). Second, their language representation is not finegrained enough to identify the part of an utterance that causes a mismatch with the image as it is (T2). Third, their visual representation is also too poor to spot and name the visual area that corresponds to a captioning error (T3).",

Zhang et al. (2016) first unveiled that there exists a huge bias in the popular VQA dataset by Antol et al. (2015) : they showed that almost half of all the questions in this dataset could be answered correctly by using the question alone and ignoring the image completely. In the same vein, Zhou et al. (2015) proposed a simple baseline for the task of VQA. This baseline simply concatenates the Bag of Words (BoW) features from the question and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) features from the image to predict the answer. They showed that such a simple method can achieve comparable performance to complex and deep architectures. Jabri et al. (2016) proposed a similar model for the task of multiple choice VQA, and suggested a cross-dataset generalization scheme as an evaluation criterion for VQA systems. We complement this research by introducing three new tasks with different levels of difficulty, on which LaVi models can be evaluated sequentially.",

They also suggest an evaluation apparently similar to our T1, requiring the LaVi system to detect the true target caption amongst the decoys. Our efforts, however, differ in some substantial ways. First, their technique to create incorrect captions (using BLEU to set an upper similarity threshold) is so that many of those captions will differ from the gold description in more than one respect. For instance, the caption two elephants standing next to each other in a grass field is associated with the decoy a herd of giraffes standing next to each other in a dirt field (errors: herd, giraffe, dirt) or with animals are gathering next to each other in a dirt field (error: dirt; infelicities: animals and gathering, which are both pragmatically odd). Clearly, the more the caption changes in the decoy, the easier the task becomes. In contrast, the foil captions we propose only differ from the gold description by one word and are thus more challenging. Secondly, the automatic caption generation of Ding et al means that 'correct' descriptions can be produced, resulting in some confusion in human responses to the task. We made sure to prevent such cases, and human performance on our dataset is thus close to 100%. We note as well that our task does not require any complex instructions for the annotation, indicating that it is intuitive to human beings (see \u00a74). Thirdly, their evaluation is a multiple-choice task, where the system has to compare all captions to understand which one is closest to the image. This is arguably a simpler task than the one we propose, where a caption is given and the system is asked to classify it as correct or foil: as we show in \u00a74, detecting a correct caption is much easier than detecting foils. So evaluating precision on both gold and foil items is crucial.",

Their study revealed that most of those metrics were only weakly correlated with human judgements. In the same line of research, Anderson et al. (2016) showed that the most widely-used metrics for IC fail to capture semantic propositional content, which is an essential component of human caption evaluation. They proposed a semantic evaluation metric called SPICE, that measures how effectively image captions recover objects, attributes and the relations between them.

In MS-COCO, each image is described by at least five descriptions written by humans via Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). The images contains 91 common object categories (e.g. dog, elephant, bird, . . . and car, bicycle, airplane, . . . ), from 11 supercategories (Animal, Vehicle, resp.), with 82 of them having more than 5K labeled instances. In total there are 123,287 images with captions (82,783 for training and 40,504 for validation). 2Our data generation process consists of four main steps, as described below.

To this end, we use Neuraltalk 3 3 https://github.com/karpathy/ neuraltalk (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015) , one of the stateof-the-art image captioning systems, pre-trained on MS-COCO. Neuraltalk is based on an LSTM which takes as input an image and generates a sentence describing its content. We obtain a neural network N that implicitly represents the visuallanguage bias through its weights. We use N to approximate the conditional probability of a caption C given a dataset T and and an image I (P (C|I, T )). This is obtained by simply using the loss l(C, N (I)) i.e., the error obtained by comparing the pseudo-ground truth C with the sentence predicted by N : P (C|I, T ) = 1l(C, N (I)) (we refer to (Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015) for more details on how l() is computed). P (C|I, T ) is used to select the hardest foil among all the possible foil captions, i.e. the one with the highest probability according to the dataset bias learned by N . Through this process, we obtain 197,788 and 99,480 original::foil caption pairs for the training and test sets, respectively.

We adapt the generative IC model to perform the classification task as follows. Given a test image I and a test caption, for each word w t in the test caption, we remove the word and use the model to generate new captions in which the w t has been replaced by the word v t predicted by the model (w 1 ,...,w t-1 , v t , w t-1 ,...,w n ). We then compare the conditional probability of the test caption with all the captions generated from it by replacing w t with v t . When all the conditional probabilities of the generated captions are lower than the one assigned to the test caption the latter is classified as good, otherwise as foil. For the other tasks, the models have been trained on T1. To perform the foil word detection task (T2), for the VQA models, we apply the occlusion method. Following (Goyal et al., 2016b) , we systematically occlude subsets of the language input, forward propagate the masked input through the model, and compute the change in the probability of the answer predicted with the unmasked original input. For the IC model, similarly to T1, we sequentially generate new captions from the foil one by replacing, one by one, the words in it and computing the conditional probability of the foil caption and the one generated from it. The word whose replacement generate the caption with the highest conditional probabilities is taken to be the foil word. Finally, to evaluate the models on the error correction task (T3), we apply the linear regression method over all the target words and select the target word which has the highest probability of making that wrong caption correct with respect to the given image.",

Subjects were given an image and a caption and had to decide whether it was correct or wrong (T1). If they thought it was wrong, they were required to mark the error in the caption (T2). We collected 2952 judgements (i.e. 3 judgements per pair and 4 judgements per rater) and computed human accuracy in T1 when considering as answer (a) the one provided by at least 2 out of 3 annotators (majority) and (b) the one provided by all 3 annotators (unanimity). The same procedure was adopted for computing accuracies in T2. Accuracies in both T1 an T2 are reported in Table 2 . As can be seen, in the majority setting annotators are quasi-perfect in classifying captions (92.89%) and detecting foil words (97.00%). Though lower, accuracies in the unanimity setting are still very high, with raters providing the correct answer in 3 out of 4 cases in both tasks. Hence, although we have collected human answers only on a rather small subset of the test set, we believe their results are representative of how easy the tasks are for humans.",

On T1, for which the chance level is 50.00%, the 'blind', language-only model, does badly with an accuracy of 55.62% (25.04% on foil captions), demonstrating that language bias is minimal. By adding visual information, CNN+LSTM, the overall accuracy increases by 5.45% (7.94% on foil captions.) reaching 61.07% (resp. 32.98%). Both SoA VQA and IC models do significantly worse than humans on both T1 and T2. The VQA systems show a strong bias towards correct captions and poor overall performance. They only identify 34.51% (LSTM +norm I) and 36.38% (HieCoAtt) of the incorrect captions (T1). On the other hand, the IC model tends to be biased toward the foil captions, on which it achieves an accuracy of 45.44%, higher than the VQA models. But the overall accuracy (42.21%) is poorer than the one obtained by the two baselines. On the foil word detection task, when considering only nouns as possible foil word, both the IC and the LSTM+norm I models perform close to chance level, and the HieCoAtt performs somewhat better, reaching 38.79%. Similar results are obtained when considering all words in the caption as possible foil. Finally, the VQA models' accuracy on foil word correction (T3) is extremely low, at 4.7% (LSTM +norm I) and 4.21% (HieCoAtt). The result on T3 makes it clear that the VQA systems are unable to extract from the image rep-resentation the information needed to correct the foil: despite being told which element in the caption is wrong, they are not able to zoom into the correct part of the image to provide a correction, or if they are, cannot name the object in that region. The IC model performs better compared to the other models, having an accuracy that is 20,78% higher than chance level. relatively to all image-caption pairs (overall) and by type of caption (correct vs. foil); T2: Accuracy for the foil word detection task, when the foil is known to be among the nouns only or when it is known to be among all the content words; T3: Accuracy for the foil word correction task when the correct word has to be chosen among any of the target words.",

We included: 1) semantic similarity between the original word and the foil (computed as the cosine between the two corresponding word2vec embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) ); 2) frequency of original word in FOIL-COCO captions; 3) frequency of the foil word in FOIL-COCO captions; 4) length of the caption (number of words). The mixed-effect model was performed to get rid of possible effects due to either object supercategory (indoor, food, vehicle, etc.) or target::foil pair (e.g., zebra::giraffe, boat::airplane, etc.). For both LSTM + norm I and HieCoAtt, word2vec similarity, frequency of the original word, and frequency of the foil word turned out to be highly reliable predictors of the model's response. The higher the values of these variables, the more the models tend to provide the wrong output. That is, when the foil word (e.g. cat) is semantically very similar to the original one (e.g. dog), the models tend to wrongly classify the caption as 'correct'. The same holds for frequency values. In particular, the higher the frequency of both the original word and the foil one, the more the models fail. This indicates that systems find it difficult to distinguish related concepts at the textvision interface, and also that they may tend to be biased towards frequently occurring concepts, 'seeing them everywhere' even when they are not present in the image. Caption length turned out to be only a partially reliable predictor in the LSTM + norm I model, whereas it is a reliable predictor in HieCoAtt. In particular, the longer the caption, the harder for the model to spot that there is a foil word that makes the caption wrong.",

As reported in Table 4 (right), both models perform nearly perfectly with some pairs and very badly with others. At first glance, it can be noticed that LSTM + norm I is very effective with pairs involving vehicles (airplane, truck, etc.), whereas HieCoAtt seems more effective with pairs involving animate nouns (i.e. animals), though more in depth analysis is needed on this point. More interestingly, some pairs that are found to be predicted almost perfectly by LSTM + I norm, namely boat::airplane, zebra::giraffe, and drier::scissors, turn out to be among the Bottom-5 cases in HieCoAtt. This suggests, on the one hand, that the two VQA models use different strategies to perform the task. On the other hand, it shows that our dataset does not contain cases that are a priori easy for any model.",

Specifically, T1 and T2 are discriminative tasks and LSTM + norm I and HieCoAtt are discriminative models. Conversely, T3 is a generative task (a word needs to be generated) and IC-Wang is a generative model. It would be interesting to test other IC models on T3 and compare their results against the ones reported here.

In the unanim-ity setting, the correct response was provided in 751 out of 984 cases (76.32%). Judging foil captions turns out to be slightly easier than judging correct captions in both settings, probably due to the presence of typos and misspellings that sometimes occur in the original caption (e.g. raters judge as wrong the original caption People playing ball with a drown and white dog, where 'brown' was misspelled as 'drown'). To better understand which factors contribute to make the task harder, we qualitatively analyse those cases where all annotators provided a wrong judgement for an image-caption pair. As partly expected, almost all cases where original captions (thus correct for the given image) are judged as being wrong are cases where the original caption is indeed incorrect. For example, a caption using the word 'motorcycle' to refer to a bicycle in the image is judged as wrong. More interesting are those cases where all raters agreed in considering as correct image-caption pairs that are instead foil. Here, it seems that vagueness as well as certain metaphorical properties of language are at play: human annotators judged as correct a caption describing Blue and banana large birds on tree with metal pot (see Fig 3, left) , where 'banana' replaced 'orange'. Similarly, all raters judged as correct the caption A cat laying on a bed next to an opened keyboard (see Fig 3, right) , where the cat is instead laying next to an opened laptop.",

We note that the addition of this extra step will move this work closer to the textual/visual explanation research (e.g., (Park et al., 2016; Selvaraju et al., 2016) ).
