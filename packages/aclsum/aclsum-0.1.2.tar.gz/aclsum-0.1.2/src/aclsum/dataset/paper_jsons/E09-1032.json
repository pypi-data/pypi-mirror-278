Recent years have seen an increasing amount of research on automatic addressee detection. Much of this work focuses on communication between humans and computational agents (such as robots or ubiquitous computing systems) that interact with users who may be engaged in other activities, including interaction with other humans. In these situations, it is important for a system to be able to recognize when it is being addressed by a user. Bakx et al. (2003) and Turnhout et al. (2005) studied this issue in the context of mixed human-human and human-computer interaction using facial orientation and utterance length as clues for addressee detection, while Katzenmaier et al. (2004) investigated whether the degree to which a user utterance fits the language model of a conversational robot can be useful in detecting system-addressed utterances. This research exploits the fact that humans tend to speak differently to systems than to other humans.",

Jovanovic and colleagues focus on addressee identification in face-to-face meetings with four participants. They use a Bayesian Network classifier trained on several multimodal features (including visual features such as gaze direction, discourse features such as the speaker and dialogue act of preceding utterances, and utterance features such as lexical clues and utterance duration). Using a combination of features from various resources was found to improve performance (the best system achieves an accuracy of 77% on a portion of the AMI Meeting Corpus). Although this result is very encouraging, it is achieved with the use of manually produced information -in particular, manual transcriptions, dialogue acts and annotations of visual focus of attention. One of the issues we aim to investigate here is how automatically extracted multimodal information can help in detecting the addressee(s) of you-utterances. We excluded the discourse marker cases, which account for only 8% of the data, and of the referential cases, selected those with an AMI addressee annotation. 3 The addressee of a dialogue act can be unknown, a single meeting participant, two participants, or the whole audience (three participants in the AMI corpus). Since there are very few instances of two-participant addressee, we distinguish only between singular and plural addressees. The resulting distribution of classes is shown in Table 1 . 4We approach the reference resolution task as a two-step process, first discriminating between plural and singular references, and then resolving the reference of the singular cases. The latter task requires a classification scheme for distinguishing between the three potential addressees (listeners) for the given you-utterance.",

For each utterance then, all of the possible values of i and j are used to construct a matrix of GDP values.

These include firstly, three features which record the candidate \"gazee\" with the highest GDP during each third of the utterance, and which therefore account for gaze transitions. So as to focus more closely on where participants are looking around the time when you is uttered, another feature records the candidate with the highest GDP -/+ 2 seconds from the start time of the you. Two further features give some indication of the amount of looking around that the speaker does during an utterance -we hypothesized that participants (especially the speaker) might look around more in utterances with plural addressees. The first is the ratio of the second highest GDP to the highest, and the second is the ratio of the third highest to the highest.

Visual features significantly improved the performance of both our manual and automatic systems, and the latter achieved an encouraging 75% accuracy. We also found that our visual features had predictive power for distinguishing between generic and referential uses of you, and between referential singulars and plurals. Indeed, for the latter task, they significantly improved the manual system's performance. The listeners' gaze features were useful here: in our data set it was apparently the case that the speaker would often use the whiteboard/projector screen when addressing the group, thus drawing the listeners' gaze in this direction. Future work will involve expanding our dataset, and investigating new potentially predictive features. In the slightly longer term, we plan to integrate the resulting system into a meeting assistant whose purpose is to automatically extract useful information from multi-party meetings.",
