                "text": "Named entities (NE) are phrases that contain names of persons, organizations, locations, etc. NER is an important task in information extraction and natural language processing (NLP) applications. Supervised learning methods can effectively solve NER problem by learning a model from manually labeled data (Borthwick, 1999; Sang and Meulder, 2003; Gao et al., 2005; Florian et al., 2003) . However, empirical study shows that NE types have different distribution across domains (Guo et al., 2006) . Trained NER classifiers in the source domain usually lose accuracy in a new target domain when the data distribution is different between both domains. Domain adaptation is a challenge for NER and other NLP applications. In the domain transfer, the reason for accuracy loss is that each NE type often has various specific term representations and context clues in the different domains. For example, {\"economist\", \"singer\", \"dancer\", \"athlete\", \"player\", \"philosopher\", ...} are used as context clues for NER. However, the distribution of these representations are varied with domains. We expect to do better domain adaptation for NER by exploiting latent semantic association among words from different domains. Some approaches have been proposed to group words into \"topics\" to capture important relationships between words, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990) , probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) (Hofmann, 1999) , Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) . These models have been successfully employed in topic modeling, dimensionality reduction for text categorization (Blei et al., 2003) , ad hoc IR (Wei and Croft., 2006) , and so on.",

We focus on capturing the hidden semantic association among words in the domain adaptation. We introduce the LaSA model to overcome the distribution difference between the source domain and the target domain. LaSA model is constructed from the unlabeled corpus at first. It learns latent semantic association among words from their related context snippets. In the domain transfer, words in the corpus are associated with a low-dimension concept space using LaSA model, then the original NER model is tuned using these generated semantic association features. The intuition behind our method is that words in one concept set will have similar semantic features or latent semantic association, and share syntactic and semantic context in the corpus. They can be considered as behaving in the same way for discriminative learning in the source and target domains. The proposed method associates words from different domains on a semantic level rather than by lexical occurrence. It can better bridge the domain distribution gap without any labeled target domain samples. Experimental results on English and Chinese corpus show that LaSA-based adaptation significantly enhances NER performance across domains.",

                "text": "Some domain adaptation techniques have been employed in NLP in recent years. Some of them focus on quantifying the generalizability of certain features across domains. Roark and Bacchiani (2003) use maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to combine training data from the source and target domains. Chelba and Acero (2004) use the parameters of the source domain maximum entropy classifier as the means of a Gaussian prior when training a new model on the target data. Daume III and Marcu (2006) use an empirical Bayes model to estimate a latent variable model grouping instances into domain-specific or common across both domains. Daume III (2007) further augments the feature space on the instances of both domains. Jiang and Zhai (2006) exploit the domain structure contained in the training examples to avoid over-fitting the training domains. Arnold et al. (2008) exploit feature hierarchy for transfer learning in NER. Instance weighting (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and active learning (Chan and Ng, 2007) are also employed in domain adaptation. Most of these approaches need the labeled target domain samples for the model estimation in the domain transfer. Obviously, they require much efforts for labeling the target domain samples. Some approaches exploit the common structure of related problems. Ando et al. (2005) learn predicative structures from multiple tasks and unlabeled data. Blitzer et al. (2006 Blitzer et al. ( , 2007) ) employ structural corresponding learning (SCL) to infer a good feature representation from unlabeled source and target data sets in the domain transfer. We present LaSA model to overcome the data gap across domains by capturing latent semantic association among words from unlabeled source and target data.",

LDA assumes that there are K \"topics\", multinomial distributions over words, which describes a collection. Each document exhibits multiple topics, and each word in each document is associated with one of them. LDA imposes a Dirichlet distribution on the topic mixture weights corresponding to the documents in the corpus. The topics derived by LDA seem to possess semantic coherence. Those words with similar semantics are likely to occur in the same topic. Since the number of LDA model parameters depends only on the number of topic mixtures and vocabulary size, LDA is less prone to over-fitting and is capable of estimating the probability of unobserved test documents.

Experimental results show that LaSA-based adaptation effectively increases the accuracy of each NE type recognition in the most of the domain transfer tests. We perform t-tests on F-measure of the comparison experiments on each NE type, respectively. All the p-value is less than 0.01, which shows that the improvement on each NE type recognition is statistically significant. Especially, the p-value of English and Chinese PER is 2.44E-06 and 9.43E-05, respectively, which shows that the improvement on PER recognition is very significant. For example, in the \"Eco\u2192Pol\" transfer on Chinese corpus, compared with F Base , LaSA-based adaptation enhances F-measure of PER recognition by 9.53 percent points. Performance enhancement for ORG recognition is less than that one for PER and LOC recognition using LaSA model since ORG NEs usually contain much more domainspecific information than PER and LOC.",

It effectively overcomes the data distribution gap across domains without using any labeled target domain data. Experimental results on English and Chinese corpus show that LaSA-based domain adaptation significantly enhances the performance of NER across domains. Especially, LaSA model effectively increases the accuracy of each NE type recognition in the domain transfer. Moreover, LaSA-based domain adaptation method works well across languages. To further reduce the accuracy loss, we will explore informative sampling to capture fine-grained data difference in the domain transfer.",
