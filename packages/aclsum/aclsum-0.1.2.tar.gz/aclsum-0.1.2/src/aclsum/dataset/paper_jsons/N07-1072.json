As a result, the structural information in the text is ignored in these approaches. We will describe a new semantic approach that takes the structural information of the text into consideration and matches skill statements on corresponding semantic roles. We will demonstrate that it can outperform standard statistical text similarity techniques, and reach the level of human agreement.",

For example, in \"Employees apply IBM infrastructure knowledge for IDBS\", \"for IDBS\" should attach to \"apply\", but many parsers mistakenly attach it to \"IBM infrastructure knowledge\". We noticed that MINIPAR performed much worse compared with the other parsers. The main reason is that it always parses the phrase \"VERB knowledge of Y\" (e.g., \"Employees apply knowledge of web technologies.\") incorrectly --the parse result always mistakenly attaches \"of Y\" (e.g., of web technologies) to the VERB (e.g., apply), not \"knowledge\". Since there were so many of phrases in the test set and in the corpus, this kind of error significantly reduced the performance for our task.

It seems that the Jiang and Conrath approach matches better with our human intuition for this example. While we didn't compare these results with human performance, in general most of the similar skill verb pairs listed in the table don't look very similar for our domain. This may be due to the fact that WordNet is a generalpurpose taxonomy --although we have already selected the most appropriate sense for each verb, their relationship represented in the taxonomy may still be quite different from the relationship in our domain. A domain-specific taxonomy for skill verbs may improve the performance. The other reason may be due to the structure of WordNet's verb taxonomy, as mentioned in (Resnik and Diab, 2000) , which is considerably wider and shallower than WordNet's noun taxonomy. A different verb lexicon, e.g., VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) , can be explored.",
