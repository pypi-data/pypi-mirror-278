At a more general level, the European integration is a purposeful movement towards some destination according to a worked out plan, getting safely through negotiation and implementation from one treaty to another, as a train moving on its rails through subsequent stations, with each nation being separate yet tied with everyone else. Numerous inferences regarding speed, timetables, stations, passengers, different classes of tickets, temporary obstacles on the tracks, and so on can be made by the reader based on the knowledge of train journeys, giving him or her a feeling of an enhanced understanding1 of the highly complex process of European integration.",

Thatcher tries to turn the train metaphor used by the pro-EU camp around. Yet, assuming metaphors are matters of choice, why should Thatcher feel constrained by her rival's choice, why doesn't she ignore it and merely suggest a new metaphor of her own design? As the evidence above suggests, this is not Thatcher's idiosyncrasy, as Major and his rivals acted similarly. Can this dynamic be explained?",

Different moves yield different utilities for a player; it is assumed that each player would pick a strategy that maximizes her utility. The observable is the actual sequence of moves; importantly, these are assumed to be the optimal outcome (an equilibrium) of the relevant game. A popular notion of equilibrium is Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1950) . For extensive form games (the type employed in this paper), the notion of subgame perfect equilibirum is typically used, denoting a Nash equilibrium that would remain such if the players start from any stage of the evolving game (Selten (1975; 1965) ).",

Interesting connections have been pointed out between game theory and machine learning: Freund and Schapire (1996) present both online learning and boosting as a repeated zero-sum game; Shalev-Shwartz and Singer (2006) show similarly that loss minimization in online learning is akin to an equilibrium path in a repeated game.",

For example, generation of referring expressions (Paraboni et al., 2007; Gardent et al., 2004; Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004; Dale and Reiter, 1995) can be rendered as a communication game with utility functions that reflect pressures to use shorter expressions while avoiding excessive ambiguity (Clark and Parikh, 2007) , with corpora annotated for entity mentions informing the design of a model. Generally, computational linguistics research produces algorithms to detect entities of various kinds, be it topics, named entities, metaphors, moves in a multi-party conversations, or syntactic constructions in large corpora; such primary data can be used to trace developments not only in chronological terms (Gruhl et al., 2004; Allan, 2002) , but in strategic terms, i.e. in terms that reflect agendas of the actors, such as political agendas in legislatures (Quinn et al., 2006) or activist forums (Greene and Resnik, 2009) , research agendas in group meetings (Morgan et al., 2001) , or social agendas in speed-dates (Jurafsky et al., 2009) . Game theoretical models are well suited for modeling dynamics that emerge under multiple, possibly conflicting constraints, as we exemplify in this article.",

Suppose that initially any state of affairs within the interval [0, 1] is assigned a uniform probability and thus merits public attention. Each in her turn, the players propose to the public to concentrate on a subset of the currently considered states of affairs, arguing that those are the likelier ones to obtain, hence merit further attention. The metaphor used to deliver the proposal describes the newly proposed subset in a way that makes those statesof-affairs that are in it aligned with the metaphor, whereas all other states are left out of the proposed metaphorical frame. As the game proceeds, the public attention is concentrated on successively smaller sets of eventualities, and these are given a more and more detailed metaphoric description, providing the educational gratification of increasingly knowing better and better what is going on. At each step, each player strives to provide maximum public gratification while leading the public to focus on the frame (i.e. subset of states of affairs) that best meets the player's preferences. 6Figure 2 sketches the frame negotiation through train metaphor, from some point in time when the general train metaphor got established, through Thatcher's flashing out the issue of excessive speed and unclear direction, Major's multi-track corrective, and reply of his opponents on the left. The final frame has all those states of affairs that fit the extended metaphor -everyone is acting within the same broad system of rules, with Britain and perhaps others sometimes wanting to negotiate special, more gradual procedures, which would leave Britain less tightly integrated into the com-munity than some other European partners.",

The rivals would suggest more specific frames either until convergence or until a situation where any further specification would produce a frame that \"misses their point,\" so-to-speak, by removing too much of the favorable outcome space for both players. Figure 3 shows a situation where parties could decide to stall on the current frame: If player 1 has to choose between retaining F 0 , or playing F 1 which would result in the rival's playing F 2 , player 1 might choose to remain in F 0 if the utility of any outcome of the subgame starting from F 2 is lower than that of F 0 , as long as player 1 believes that player 2 would reason similarly. The idea of the proof is to construct a pair of strategies where each side attempts to pull the publicly accepted frame in the direction of its peak utility point. We show, assuming the peak of the first mover is to the left of peak of the second, that any deviation of the first mover would enable the second to shift the public frame more to the right, to an outcome of lower utility to the first mover. The full details of the proof of part 1 are given in the appendix; part 2 is proved in an accompanying technical report.",

Metaphors are notorious for allowing subliminal framing, where the metaphor seems so natural that the aspects of the phenomenon in question that do not align with the metaphor are seamlessly concealed. For example, WAR AS A COMPETITIVE GAME metaphor emphasizes the glory of winning and the shame of defeat, but hides the death-and-suffering aspect of the war, which makes sports metaphors a strategic choice when wishing to arouse a pro-war sentiment in the audience (Lakoff, 1991) .

Thus, rather than contesting the validity of the metaphoric frame, politicians strive to find a way to turn the metaphor around, i.e. accept the general framework, but focus on a previously unexplored aspect that would lead to a different evaluative tilt. Our results show that being the first to use an effective metaphor that manages to lock the public in its framework is a strategic advantage as the need to communicate with the same public would compel the rival to take up the metaphor of your choice. To our knowledge, this is the first explanation of the use of extended metaphor in political communication on a complex issue in terms of the agendas of the rival parties and the changing disposition of the public being addressed. It is an open question whether similar \"locking in\" of the public can be attained by non-metaphorical means, and whether the ensuing dynamics would be similar.",

Since by definition \u03c3 * 2 always chooses an entropy maximizing segment, for player 1 to choose a non-entropy maximizing segment (more or less than half the length) amounts to yielding the round to player 2, which is equivalent in terms of the resulting accepted frame to a situation where player 1 chooses an entropy maximizing segment -the same one chosen by player 2.
