However, OE learns a deterministic knowledge base, limiting expressiveness of queries and the ability to use uncertainty for both prediction and learning (e.g. learning from expectations). Probabilistic extensions of OE (Lai and Hockenmaier, 2017) have provided the ability to somewhat calibrate these denotational probabilities while retaining the consistency and inductive bias of ordered models, but lack the ability to model the negative correlations found in real-world knowledge. In this work we show that a broad class of models that assign probability measures to OE can never capture negative correlation, which motivates our construction of a novel box lattice and accompanying probability measure to capture anticorrelation and even disjoint concepts, while still providing the benefits of probabilistic modeling, such as the ability to perform rich joint and conditional queries over arbitrary sets of concepts, and both learning from and predicting calibrated uncertainty. We show improvements over previous approaches in modeling the Flickr and WordNet entailment graphs, and investigate the power of the model.",

However, while the space of representations is a manifold of probability distributions, the model is not truly probabilistic in that it does not model asymmetries and relations in terms of prob-abilities, but in terms of asymmetric comparison functions such as the originally proposed KL divergence and the recently proposed thresholded divergences (Athiwaratkun and Wilson, 2018) .",

Moreover, there are large degrees of freedom in parameter space that exhibit this slackness, giving the model the ability to embed complex structure with 0 loss when compared to models based on symmetric inner products or distances between embeddings, e.g. bilinear GLMs (Collins et al., 2002) , Trans-E (Bordes et al., 2013) , and other embedding models which must always be pushing and pulling parameters towards and away from each other.",

A matrix of pairwise Gaussian KL divergences cannot be consistently asymmetrized in this manner. These claims are proven in Appendix C. While a high P (a|b) does not always indicate an edge in an ontology due to confounding variables, existing graphical model structure learning methods can be used to further prune on the base graph without adding a cycle, such as Graphical Lasso or simple thresholding (Fattahi and Sojoudi, 2017) .",

To remedy this, we propose to learn representations in the space of all boxes (axis-aligned hyperrectangles), gaining back an extra degree of freedom.

We also conduct a parallel experiment with POE as embedded in the unit cube, where each representation is constrained to touch the faces x = 1, y = 1. In Figure 2 , we show the representation of lattice structures by POE and the box lattice model as compared to the abstract probabilistic lattice used to construct the data, shown in Figure 1 , and compare the conditional probabilities produced by our model to the ground truth, demonstrating the richer capacity of the box model in capturing strong positive and negative correlations. In Table 1 , we perform a series of multivariable conditional queries and demonstrate intuitive results on high-order queries containing up to 4 variables, despite the model being trained on only 2-way information.",

We also observe sensible negatively correlated examples, shown in 2, in the trained box model, while POE cannot represent such relationships. We tune our models on the development set, with parameters documented in Appendix D.1. We observe that not only does our model outperform POE, it beats all previous results on WordNet, aside from the concurrent work of Athiwaratkun and Wilson (2018) (using different train/dev negative examples), the baseline POE model does as well. This indicates that probabilistic embeddings for transitive relations are a promising avenue for future work. Additionally, the ability of the model to learn from the expected \"soft edges\" improves it to state-of-the-art level. We expect that co-occurrence counts gathered from real textual corpora, rather than merely aggregating up the WordNet lattice, would further strengthen this effect.
