Unlike many other social networking platforms, such as Facebook and LinkedIn, Twitter does not provide structured fields for users to fill in personal information. However, a user can write a 160-character-long small public summary about itself called a \"Bio\". Besides linguistic information from tweets and Bios, online social media is a rich source of network information. People's personal networks are homogeneous, i.e., friends share more attributes such as race, ethnicity, religion, and occupation-known as the homophily principle (McPherson et al., 2001) . Such network information has been utilized in friend recommendation (Guy et al., 2010) , community detection Follow Figure 1 : User and Network information on Twitter Microblog. (Yang and Leskovec, 2013) , etc. Figure 1 shows two users connected on Twitter. By looking at their Bio and tweets, it can be inferred that these users share the same occupational interest.",

User occupational class prediction is an important component of user profiling and a sub-task of user demographic feature prediction. Existing approaches to predicting Twitter users' demographic attributes explore, select, and combine various features generated from text and network to achieve the best predictive performances in respective classification tasks (Han et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2012; Preot \u00b8iuc-Pietro et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015; Aletras and Chamberlain, 2018) . The three categories of features are: account level features, tweet text features, and network based features. Past research have shown the distinctive usage of language across gender, age, location, etc. in tweets (Sloan et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2010) , which makes content based prediction effective.",

Next, we calculate the cluster assigning frequencies for each main ID. (2) bag-of-words (BOW): since the initial dataset used the Bio information of the main users to annotate their occupations, we remove all the Bio information of main users. We kept only the most frequent 5,000 words from the Bio (of other users) and another 5,000 words from tweets text as the dictionary of separate BOW vectors to the model. We feed the obtained text features and node embedding features to both the Logistic Regression (LR) classifier and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier3 . Both classifiers are trained following the one-vsall approach for the 9-way classification task. 2 regularization is used for LR, whose coefficient is tuned based on the development set.

Our best result 61.0% accuracy is achieved by using GCN with one-hot encoding for nodes, which is significantly higher than existing methods. This shows that GCN is able to exploit the rich topological information of network to learn social representations for users. We postulate that the GCN with Bio did not do better than just a one-hot encoding for nodes because the main users do not have Bios: so all the labeled nodes in the GCN have no Bios, which makes learning difficult. We visualize the GCN final layer representations of training set (big ovals) and test set (dark colored dots) in Figure 3a . It can be observed that many test data samples are mapped to the correct group of occupation, showing the capability of GCN utilizing Twitter network information for the prediction task. To analyze wrongly mapped test samples, we observed confusion matrix as shown in Figure 3b . We see that group 4 is predicted as belonging to group 1 or 2. When we compare the jobs lying in groups 1, 2, and 4, we found that they contain similar types of sub-occupations, such as \"financial account managers\" and \"finance officers\", or \"engineers\" and \"engineering technicians\". The same phenomenon can be seen for group 9 and group 5. Figure 3c compares the performance of two models, using tweet only features (LR-tweets) and follow network features (GCN-Bio), based on a fraction of training samples used for model learning.
