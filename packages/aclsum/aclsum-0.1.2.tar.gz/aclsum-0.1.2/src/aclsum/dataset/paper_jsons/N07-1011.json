First, it is not clear how best to convert the set of pairwise classifications into a disjoint clustering of noun phrases. The problem stems from the transitivity constraints of coreference: If a and b are coreferent, and b and c are coreferent, then a and c must be coreferent. This problem has recently been addressed by a number of researchers. A simple approach is to perform the transitive closure of the pairwise decisions. However, as shown in recent work (McCallum and Wellner, 2003; Singla and Domingos, 2005) , better performance can be obtained by performing relational inference to directly consider the dependence among a set of predictions. For example, McCallum and Wellner (2005) apply a graph partitioning algorithm on a weighted, undirected graph in which vertices are noun phrases and edges are weighted by the pairwise score between noun phrases.",

Perhaps the most related is \"learning as search optimization\" (LASO) (Daum\u00e9 III and Marcu, 2005b; Daum\u00e9 III and Marcu, 2005a) . Like the current paper, LASO is also an error-driven training method that integrates prediction and training. However, whereas we explicitly use a ranking-based loss function, LASO uses a binary classification loss function that labels each candidate structure as correct or incorrect. Thus, each LASO training example contains all candidate predictions, whereas our training examples contain only the highest scoring incorrect prediction and the highest scoring correct prediction. Our experiments show the advantages of this ranking-based loss function. Additionally, we provide an empirical study to quantify the effects of different example generation and loss function decisions. Collins and Roark (2004) present an incremental perceptron algorithm for parsing that uses \"early update\" to update the parameters when an error is encountered. Our method uses a similar \"early update\" in that training examples are only generated for the first mistake made during prediction. However, they do not investigate rank-based loss functions.",

                "text": "There have been a number of machine learning approaches to coreference resolution, traditionally factored into classification decisions over pairs of nouns (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002) . Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) combine pairwise classification with graph-cut algorithms. Luo et al. (2004) do enable features between mention-cluster pairs, but do not perform the error-driven and ranking enhancements proposed in our work. Denis and Baldridge (2007) use a ranking loss function for pronoun coreference; however the examples are still pairs of pronouns, and the example generation is not error driven. Ng (2005) learns a meta-classifier to choose the best prediction from the output of several coreference systems. While in theory a metaclassifier can flexibly represent features, they do not explore features using the full flexibility of first-order logic. Also, their method is neither errordriven nor rank-based. McCallum and Wellner (2003) use a conditional random field that factors into a product of pairwise decisions about pairs of nouns. These pairwise decisions are made collectively using relational inference; however, as pointed out in Milch et al. (2004) , this model has limited representational power since it does not capture features of entities, only of pairs of mention. Milch et al. (2005) address these issues by constructing a generative probabilistic model, where noun clusters are sampled from a generative process. Our current work has similar representational flexibility as Milch et al. (2005) but is discriminatively trained.",

By relying on sampling methods at training time and approximate inference methods at testing time, this approach can be made scalable. This results in a coreference model that can capture features over sets of noun phrases, rather than simply pairs of noun phrases. This is an example of a model with extremely flexible representational power, but for which exact inference is intractable. The simple approximations we have described here have enabled this more flexible model to outperform a model that is simplified for tractability.",
