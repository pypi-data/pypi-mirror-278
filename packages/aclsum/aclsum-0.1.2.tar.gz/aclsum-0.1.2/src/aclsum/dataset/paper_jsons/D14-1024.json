Generally, automatically extracted lexicons of MWEs are employed in the identification step. Further, various integration strategies have been proposed. The so called static strategy suggests training the SMT system on corpora in which each MWE is treated as a single unit, e.g. call off. This improves SMT indirectly by improving the alignment between source and target sentences in the training data. Various versions of this strategy are applied in Lambert and Banchs (2005) , Carpuat and Diab (2010) , and Simova and Kordoni (2013) . In all cases there is some improvement in translation quality, caused mainly by the better treatment of separable PVs, such as in turn the light on.",

Other approaches perform feature mining and modify directly the automatically extracted translation table. Ren et al. (2009) and Simova and Kordoni (2013) employ Moses1 to build and train phrase-based SMT systems and then, in addition to the standard phrasal translational probabilities, they add a binary feature which indicates whether an MWE is present in a given source phrase or not. Carpuat and Diab (2010) employ the same approach but the additional feature indicates the number of MWEs in each phrase.

Since it is their peculiar linguistic nature that makes those expressions problematic for SMT, it is our thesis that providing more linguistic information to the translation process will improve it. In particular, we concentrate on a specific type of MWEs, namely phrasal verbs (PVs). We add 4 binary features to the translation table which indicate not only the presence of a PV but also its transitivity, separability, and idiomaticity. We found that PVs are very suitable for this study since we can easily extract the necessary informa-tion from various language resources.",

For Bulgarian, these tasks were performed with the BTB-LPP tagger (Savkov et al., 2011) . Simova and Kordoni (2013) create automatically a lexicon containing English PVs.

Our method dynamic-4 produces more good translations and less incorrect ones than all other setups. This illustrates further the benefits of adding linguistic features to the translation model. The results achieved by the static approach are attributed to the better handling of separable PVs in sentences where the particle was not adjacent to the verb. The dynamic-1 approach and the baseline often interpret the particle literally in such cases which leads to almost twice the amount of wrong translations. Our method, on the other hand, performs slightly lower than the static approach in this respect but still much better than the other 2 setups. Compared to dynamic-1 and the baseline, the static approach also handles better idiomatic PVs but performs slightly worse for sentences with compositional PVs. However, the addition of a specific feature to encode idiomaticity in the translation model enables our method dynamic-4 to achieve the best performance for idiomatic PVs while still handling successfully many compositional PVs. To summarise, the improved results of our method in comparison to previous work are attributed to the better handling of separable PVs which occur in a split form and even more to the improved ability to differentiate between compositional and idiomatic PVs.",
