Such techniques may yield \"false negative\" causality results: models may use representations of syntax, but probes may have learned to use redundant encodings of the same syntactic information. We demonstrate that models do encode syntactic information redundantly and introduce a new probe design that guides probes to consider all syntactic information present in embeddings. Using these probes, we find evidence for the use of syntax in models where prior methods did not, allowing us to boost model performance by injecting syntactic information into representations.\nHere, we identify a limitation of prior causal probing art in which redundant information in embeddings could lead to probes and models using different representations of the same information, which in turn could lead to uninformative causal analysis results. We propose a new probe architecture that addresses this limitation by encouraging probes to use all sources of information in embeddings.",

First, we find evidence for representational redundancy in BERTbased models. Based on these findings, we propose a new probe design that encourages the probe to use all relevant representations of syntax in model embeddings. These probes are then used to assess if language models use representations of syntax causally, and, unlike prior art, we find that some fine-tuned models do exhibit signatures of causal use of syntactic information. Lastly, having found that these models causally use representations of syntax, we used our probes to boost a questionanswering model's performance by \"injecting\" syntactic information at test time.1 2 Related Work",

For example, Hewitt and Manning (2019) propose single-layered neural nets that map from embeddings to syntactic representations of sentences. Such probing methods are correlative rather than causal because they depict what information is present in representations instead of how that information is used (Hall Maudslay et al., 2020; Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018) .

(2021) train non-linear structural probes (based on those designed by Hewitt and Manning (2019) ) to predict aspects of a sentence's syntactic structure from model embeddings. That is, a probe p maps from an embedding, z, to a representation of syntax, s. Trained probes are used to create counterfactual embeddings, z \u2032 , by updating z \u2032 from z via gradient descent to minimize a loss function, L, evaluated on the probe's output and a desired output based on an alternative syntactic interpretation, s \u2032 : \u2207 z \u2032 L(p(z \u2032 ), s \u2032 ). Intuitively, these z \u2032 are meant to represent \"what z would have been if the structure of the sentence were s \u2032 .\" Using suites of syntactically ambiguous sentences, the authors measured how a model's outputs differed when using z \u2032 generated from different syntactic interpretations.",

Because M k+ uses only z dep 1 for predictions, the model's output will not change. This example is depicted in Figure 2 .

Probes were trained for up to 100 epochs, with early stopping based on validation set loss, using the Penn TreeBank dataset (Marcus et al., 1993) . We found that this produced more accurate probes than prior art, which capped training at 30 epochs, and that these resulting probes did better than prior reported results, even without using dropout. Each probe was prefixed by a dropout layer with a parameter, \u03b1, that specified the proportion of inputs that were masked before being fed to the probe. By setting \u03b1 = 0, we recreated prior art of standard probes. We additionally investigated positive values of \u03b1 to measure the benefit of dropout. Counterfactual embeddings were created via gradient descent through trained probes (with dropout disabled), as in prior art (Tucker et al., 2021) . That is, new embeddings, z \u2032 , were generated to decrease the loss between p(z \u2032 ) and a desired parse. We called this loss the counterfactual loss.",

In the left column of Figure 5 , we found similar results to prior art: using standard depth-based probes produced noisy results, and distance-based probes had a small effect. (In fact, this effect size shrank if we only trained the distance probe for 30 epochs, as in prior art, instead of the 100 epochs we used, indicating the importance of well-trained probes.)

Next, we include the mean causal effect plots for Mask and QA models using both types of probes on the 5 total suites.First, we plotted an example of how increasing the dropout rate grew the causal effect in the QA attachment quite in Figure 8 . We found that positive dropout values consistently outperformed probes with no dropout. Furthermore, for \u03b1 ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, increasing the dropout rate seemed to increase the effect size. Considering only interventions at layer 2, for example, vanilla probes shifted model predictions by at most 2% for different parses; for probes with dropout 0.5, probabilities shifted by roughly 20%.Finally, we included results for all dropout rates and counterfactual losses in Figures 9 and 10 .",

One could hypothesize that the dropout enables better counterfactuals because the probes are prevented from overfitting to the training data. We found that that was not the case.In Figure 11 , we plotted probe performance metrics for the distance-and depth-based probes. For the distance probe, we reported the spearman correlation coefficient between predicted and actual pairwise distances between words in a sentence's parse tree. For the depth probe, we reported the accuracy of the probe in predicting the word at the root of the syntax tree. Both metrics were used in prior probing literature (Hewitt and Manning, 2019) . We found that, while using non-linear probes boosted probe performance compared to linear probes, adding dropout actually worsened probe performance.
