As a possible application scenario, CLTE can be used to address content merging tasks in tidy multilingual environments, such as commercial Web sites, digital libraries, or user generated content collections. Within such framework, as it will be discussed in the last section of this paper, CLTE components can be used for automatic content synchronization in a concurrent, collaborative, and multilingual editing setting, e.g. Wikipedia.",

For instance, let the French hypothesis H be translated into English and then run the TE engine on T and the translation of H. There are several good reasons to follow this divide-and-conquer approach, as well as some drawbacks. Decoupling the cross-lingual and the entailment components results in a simple and modular architecture that, according to well known software engineering principles, results easier to develop, debug, and maintain. Moreover, a decoupled CLTE architecture would allow for easy extensions to other languages as it just requires extra MT systems. Along the same idea of pivoting through English, in fact, the same TE system can be employed to perform CLTE between any language pair, once MT is available from each language into English. A drawback of the decoupled approach is that as MT is still far from being perfect, translation errors are propagated to the TE engine and might likely affect performance. To cope with this issue, we explored the alternative approach of applying TE on a list of n-best translations provided by the MT engine, and take a final decision based on some system combination criterion. This latter approach potentially reduces the impact of translation errors, but might significantly increase the computational requirements of CLTE.",

This could result in methods for recognizing TE across languages without translating the texts and, in principle, with a lower complexity. When dealing with phrase-based statistical MT (Koehn et al., 2007) , a possible approach is to extract information from the phrase-table to enrich the inference and entailment rules which could be used in a distance based entailment system. As an example the entailment relations between the French phrase \"ordinateur portable\" and the English phrase \"laptop\", or between the German phrase \"europaeischen union\" and the English word \"Europe\" could be captured from parallel corpora through statistical phrase-based MT approaches.",

Knowing that Google has one of the best French-English translation models, the downtrend of results using Moses translator, in contrast with Google, is not out of our expectation. Trying to bridge this gap brings us to the next round of experiments, where we extracted the n-best trans- lations produced by Moses, to have a richer lexical variability, beneficial for improving the TE recognition. The graph in Figure 1 shows an incremental improvement when the n-best translated hypotheses are used. Besides that, trying to reach a more monotonic distribution of the results, we normalized the ranking score (from 0 to 1) given by Moses, and in each step we chose the first n results over a normalized score. In this way, having the hypotheses with the score of above 0.4, we achieved the highest accuracy of 62.9%. This is exactly equal to adopting the 30-best hypotheses translated by Moses. Using this method, we could improve the performance up to 1.5% above the 1 st best results, achieving almost the same level of performance obtained with Google.",
