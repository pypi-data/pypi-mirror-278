# AutoIP

AutoIP is a Python package that automates IP address changes using Tor. It is a top tool for securing your networks by frequently changing your IP address, making it difficult for trackers to pinpoint your location.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Privacy**: By regularly changing your IP address, AutoIP makes it much harder for websites and trackers to monitor your online activity.
- **Increased Security**: Frequent IP changes can help protect you from targeted attacks and make it more difficult for malicious actors to track your online presence.
- **Anonymity**: Using Tor, AutoIP helps you maintain a high level of anonymity while browsing the internet.
- **Ease of Use**: AutoIP is designed to be simple and easy to use, whether you prefer command-line tools or integrating it directly into your Python scripts.
- **Protection from Tracking**: With your IP address changing frequently, tracking services and advertisers will find it more challenging to build a profile on you.
- **Peace of Mind**: Knowing that your IP address is regularly changed can give you confidence in your online privacy and security.


## Installation

You can install AutoIP using pip:

```bash
pip install autoip
```

## Usage

AutoIP provides a command-line interface for easy use. Here are the available options:

```bash
autoip --interval <seconds> --count <number>
```

- `--interval` (optional): Time in seconds between IP changes (default is 60 seconds).
- `--count` (optional): Number of times to change the IP (default is 10 times). If set to 0, the IP will be changed indefinitely.
- `--ip` (optional): Display the current IP address and exit.
- `--auto-fix` (optional): Automatically fix issues (install/upgrade packages).
- `--help`: Show the help message and exit.
- `--version`: Show the version number and exit.

### Examples

Change the IP address every 30 seconds, for a total of 5 times:

```bash
autoip --interval 30 --count 5
```

Change the IP address every 60 seconds indefinitely:

```bash
autoip --interval 60 --count 0
```

Display the current IP address:

```bash
autoip --ip
```

Automatically fix issues (install/upgrade packages):

```bash
autoip --auto-fix
```

## In Your Python Code

You can also use AutoIP within your Python scripts if needed.

```python
from autoip import ma_ip, change_ip, initialize_environment, change_ip_repeatedly

# Initialize the environment (install dependencies and start Tor)
initialize_environment()

# Get the current IP
current_ip = ma_ip()
print("Current IP:", current_ip)

# Change the IP once
new_ip = change_ip()
print("New IP:", new_ip)

# Change the IP repeatedly
change_ip_repeatedly(60, 10)
```
## Thanks
Thank you for using AutoIP! We hope this tool helps you secure your network and maintain your privacy.
