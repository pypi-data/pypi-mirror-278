			Without paragon talent at distributing goodest
			food, humanity's humane capacity to defend
			against the attack of advanced super plants
			that can devour galaxies in one bite 
			is never going to be sufficient.
			
			As long as "goodest" is entirely
			for "goodest" endeavors, it can be deemed as 
			subject to the terms of every 
			license that can be found in "./list" directory".
