    A species of agents represents a general method for eco-evolutionary algorithms environment-agnostic.

    It contains those two general notions :
    - How an agent reacts to its observation "o", where "o" is the observation received by the agent from the environment ?
    - What is the reproduction mecanism between agents indexes "i1", "i2", ..., "in", where those indexes are received from the environment ?

    For obeying the constant shape paradigm, even if the number of agents in the simulation is not constant, the number of "potential agents" is constant and equal to n_agents_max.
    This imply that any BaseAgentSpecies instance should maintain a population of n_agents_max agents, even if some of them are not existing in the simulation at a given time.
