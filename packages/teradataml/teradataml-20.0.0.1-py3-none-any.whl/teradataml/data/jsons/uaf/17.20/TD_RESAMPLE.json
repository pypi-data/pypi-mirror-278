Resampling functions generally take as an input: a time series, which can be regular or irregular to begin with; a starting point, aka, 'time-zero'; and a desired target sampling interval.  There are usually multiple choices available to the data scientist as to how the interpolation associated with the sample interval change is going to occur."
