Description: # HackAtari
        
        This repository relies on OCAtari, a fork of the OpenAI Gym Atari environment. 
        The OCAtari repository can be found [here](https://github.com/k4ntz/OC_Atari)
        
        
        ## Installation
        To install the OCAtari environment, please follow the instructions in the OCAtari repository,
        or simply run the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install ocatari
        ```
        To install the hackatari environment, please clone this repository and run the following command:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/k4ntz/HackAtari
        cd HackAtari
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To use the HackAtari environment, simply import it as you would any other OpenAI Gym environment:
        You can run the `run.py` file to start the original game or any of the modified versions.
        E.g.:
        ```python
        python run.py -g Freeway # Starts normal Freeway (random agent)
        python run.py -g Freeway -hu # Starts Freeway with the cars being invisible (interactive/human playing mode)
        python run.py -g Freeway -m color8 # Starts Freeway with the cars of color #8 being (i.e. invisible) (random agent)
        python run.py -g Freeway -m stop3 # Starts Freeway with stopping mode #3 (i.e. static cars) (random agent)
        python run.py -g Seaquest -m oxygen disable_enemies gravity # Starts Seaquest with infinite oxygen, no enemy, gravity (random agent)
        python run.py -g Kangaroo -m random_init disable_monkeys # Starts Kangaroo with random initial floor and no monkeys (random agent)
        ```
        
        See bellow for a complete list of all modifications and their corresponding arguments.
        
        This is the list of games we have created new Versions and options for during the "HackAtari" project. Each file, when started without additional parameters, starts the original game played by the DQN agent.
        All modes/hacks/changes can be activated individually or in any combination via the command line.
        
        For all games, you can use `-hu` argument on the script to start the game in Human Mode and play the game yourself.
        
        
        Below you will find a list of modified games with their respective command line commands and their effects.
