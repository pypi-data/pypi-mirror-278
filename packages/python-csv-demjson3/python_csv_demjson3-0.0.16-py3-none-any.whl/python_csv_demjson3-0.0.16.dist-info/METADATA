    remove or keep certain rows, remove or keep certain columns, adjust columns or create new columns from old (some similarity to awk)

pagg: 
    run aggregations on the csv (somewhat like GROUP BY in SQL)

    sort csv files by a column

to_csv:

**Credits**
    This package is published to resolve demjson/setuptools issue in original python-csv, since maintainer of python-csv has not released the fix in PyPi and many users struggling due to demjson, which is now updated to demjson3 and should not cause setuptools issue. 

    Well, all CREDIT GOES TO Jason Trigg and it owner of this library. https://github.com/jasontrigg0/python-csv
