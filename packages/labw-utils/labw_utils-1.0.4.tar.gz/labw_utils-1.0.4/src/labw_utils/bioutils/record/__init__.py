``labw_utils.bioutils.record`` -- Records

Here contains some basic POJO-like record dara structures for various formats.
They are designed to work on Python built-in libraries only without loading third-party packages.

They are designed to be read-only,
so although possible, do not attempt modification on the instances of these objects.
Always create new records if needed.
