Analytical Growth Rates
=======================

The following example illustrates how to obtain growth rates from intra-beam scattering  in Xsuite.
The functionality is exposed through the `TwissTable` and can make use of two different formalism, ``Nagaitsev`` and ``Bjorken-Mtingwa``.
The former provides a computationally efficient approach but does not account for vertical dispersion, while the latter accounts for it but is slower.
