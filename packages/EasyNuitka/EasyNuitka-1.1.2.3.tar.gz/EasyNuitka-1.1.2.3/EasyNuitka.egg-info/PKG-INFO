        Requirements
        ============
        
        -  C Compiler: You need a compiler with support for C11 or alternatively
           for C++03 [#]_
        
           Currently this means, you need to use one of these compilers:
        
           -  The MinGW64 C11 compiler on Windows, must be based on gcc 11.2 or
              higher. It will be *automatically* downloaded if no usable C
              compiler is found, which is the recommended way of installing it,
              as Nuitka will also upgrade it for you.
        
           -  Visual Studio 2022 or higher on Windows [#]_, older versions will
              work but only supported for commercial users. Configure to use the
              English language pack for best results (Nuitka filters away
              garbage outputs, but only for English language). It will be used
              by default if installed.
        
           -  On all other platforms, the ``gcc`` compiler of at least version
              5.1, and below that the ``g++`` compiler of at least version 4.4
              as an alternative.
        
           -  The ``clang`` compiler on macOS X and most FreeBSD architectures.
        
           -  On Windows the ``clang-cl`` compiler on Windows can be used if
              provided by the Visual Studio installer.
        
        -  Python: Version 2.6, 2.7 or 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10
        
           .. important::
        
              For Python 3.3/3.4 and *only* those, we need other Python version
              as a *compile time* dependency.
        
              Nuitka itself is fully compatible with all listed versions, but
              Scons as an internally used tool is not.
        
              For these versions, you *need* a Python2 or Python 3.5 or higher
              installed as well, but only during the compile time only. That is
              for use with Scons (which orchestrates the C compilation), which
              does not support the same Python versions as Nuitka.
        
              In addition, on Windows, Python2 cannot be used because
              ``clcache`` does not work with it, there a Python 3.5 or higher
              needs to be installed.
        
              Nuitka finds these needed Python versions (e.g. on Windows via
              registry) and you shouldn't notice it as long as they are
              installed.
        
              Increasingly, other functionality is available when another Python
              has a certain package installed. For example, onefile compression
              will work for a Python 2.x when another Python is found that has
              the ``zstandard`` package installed.
        
           .. admonition:: Moving binaries to other machines
        
              The created binaries can be made executable independent of the
              Python installation, with ``--standalone`` and ``--onefile``
              options.
        
           .. admonition:: Binary filename suffix
        
              The created binaries have an ``.exe`` suffix on Windows. On other
              platforms they have no suffix for standalone mode, or ``.bin``
              suffix, that you are free to remove or change, or specify with the
              ``-o`` option.
        
              The suffix for acceleration mode is added just to be sure that the
              original script name and the binary name do not ever collide, so
              we can safely do an overwrite without destroying the original
              source file.
        
           .. admonition:: It **has to** be CPython, Anaconda Python.
        
              You need the standard Python implementation, called "CPython", to
              execute Nuitka, because it is closely tied to implementation
              details of it.
        
           .. admonition:: It **cannot be** from Windows app store
        
              It is known that Windows app store Python definitely does not
              work, it's checked against. And on macOS "pyenv" likely does
              **not** work.
        
        -  Operating System: Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS X, and Windows (32/64
           bits).
        
           Others may work as well. The portability is expected to be generally
           good, but the e.g. Scons usage may have to be adapted. Make sure to
           match Windows Python and C compiler architecture, or else you will
           get cryptic error messages.
        
        -  Architectures: x86, x86_64 (amd64), and arm, likely many more
        
           Other architectures are expected to also work, out of the box, as
           Nuitka is generally not using any hardware specifics. These are just
           the ones tested and known to be good. Feedback is welcome. Generally,
           the architectures that Debian supports can be considered good and
           tested too.
        
        .. [#]
        
           Support for this C11 is a given with gcc 5.x or higher or any clang
           version.
        
           The MSVC compiler doesn't do it yet. But as a workaround, as the C++03
           language standard is very overlapping with C11, it is then used instead
           where the C compiler is too old. Nuitka used to require a C++ compiler
           in the past, but it changed.

           https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx
           (the community editions work just fine).
        
           The latest version is recommended but not required. On the other hand,
           there is no need to except pre-Windows 10 support, and they might work
           for you, but support of these configurations is only available to
           commercial users.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        For most systems, there will be packages on the `download page
        <https://nuitka.net/doc/download.html>`__ of Nuitka. But you can also
        install it from source code as described above, but also like any other
        Python program it can be installed via the normal ``python setup.py
        install`` routine.
