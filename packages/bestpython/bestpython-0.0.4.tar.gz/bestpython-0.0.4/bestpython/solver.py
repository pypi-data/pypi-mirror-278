        The head model, as returned by GetHeadModel.
    mem_options : dict
        The options for the MEM solver, as returned by GetMEMOptions.
    Returns
    -------
    X : array, (n_active_dipoles, n_times)
        The time series of the dipoles in the active set.
    active_set : array (n_dipoles)
        Array of bool. Entry j is True if dipole j is in the active set.
        We have ``X_full[active_set] == X`` where X_full is the full X matrix
        such that ``M = G X_full``.

    This function does all the necessary computation:

    - to select the channels in the forward given the available ones in
      the data
    - to take into account the noise covariance and do the spatial whitening
    - to apply loose orientation constraint as MNE solvers
    - to apply a weigthing of the columns of the forward operator as in the
      weighted Minimum Norm formulation in order to limit the problem
      of depth bias.

    Parameters
    ----------
    eng: matlab.engine
        The MATLAB engine.
    evoked : instance of mne.Evoked
        The evoked data
    forward : instance of Forward
        The forward solution.
    noise_cov : instance of Covariance
        The noise covariance.
    head_model : dict
        The head model, as returned by GetHeadModel.
    memOptions : dict
        The options for the MEM solver, as returned by GetMEMOptions.
    loose : float in [0, 1] | 'auto'
        Value that weights the source variances of the dipole components
        that are parallel (tangential) to the cortical surface. If loose
        is 0 then the solution is computed with fixed orientation.
        If loose is 1, it corresponds to free orientations.
        The default value ('auto') is set to 0.2 for surface-oriented source
        space and set to 1.0 for volumic or discrete source space.
    depth : None | float in [0, 1]
        Depth weighting coefficients. If None, no depth weighting is performed.

    Returns
    -------
    stc : instance of SourceEstimate
        The source estimates.
