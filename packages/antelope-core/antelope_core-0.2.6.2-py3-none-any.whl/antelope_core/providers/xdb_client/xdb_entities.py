        XdbEntity is an ephemeral object, basically a way of storing pydantic models PRIOR to their getting made into
        refs (which is done by this class's make_ref() process)

        XdbEntities are instantiated by the client on any occasion the client receives info on entities back from
        the remote server: in XdbClient._fetch(), and in processes() flows() quantities() and anything to do with
        exchanges.

        The return objects are immediately used as arguments for BasicQuery.make_ref() or CatalogQuery.make_ref(),
        either of which calls this class's make_ref() with the query as argument.  Then the make_ref() is responsible
        for constructing the fully-featured reference object that is stored in the local archive.

        Must supply the pydantic model that comes out of the query, and also the archive that stores the ref
