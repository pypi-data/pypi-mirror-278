    Assumes a fuzzy set of subgraphs whose nodes are included with probability proportional to their scores,
    as per the formulation of [krasanakis2019linkauc] and calculates E[outgoing edges] / E[internal edges] of
    the fuzzy rank subgraph. To avoid potential optimization towards filling the whole graph, the measure is
    evaluated to infinity if either denominator *or* the nominator is zero (this means that whole connected components
    should not be extracted).
    If scores assume binary values, E[.] becomes set size and this calculates the induced subgraph Conductance.

        Args:
            max_rank: Optional. The maximum value scores can assume. To maintain a probabilistic formulation of
             conductance, this can be greater but not less than the maximum rank during evaluation. Default is 1.
             Pass algorithms through a normalization to ensure that this limit is not violated.
            autofix: Optional. If True, automatically normalizes scores by multiplying with max_rank / their maximum.
             If False (default) and the maximum score is greater than max_rank, an exception is thrown.
