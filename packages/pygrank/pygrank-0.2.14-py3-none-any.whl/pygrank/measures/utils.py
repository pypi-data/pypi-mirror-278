    """
    Splits a graph signal, iterable of map of graph signals and iterables into two same-type objects
    with training and test data respectively. For graph signals, training and test data are
    basically masked to output zeros more times and this method takes care to stratify sampling
    between non-zero and zero values.

    Args:
        groups: The input data to split.
        training_samples: If less than 1, it determines the fraction of training data to use for training. If greater
            than 1, it determines the absolute number of training data points. If 1, the data are not split but
            used for both training and testing. Default is 0.8 to use 80% data for training and the rest 20% for
            testing.
        seed: A sample to introu

    Returns:
        Data with the same organization as the *groups* argument.

    Example:
        >>> import pygrank as pg
        >>> training, test = pg.split(["A", "B", "C", "D"], training_samples=0.5)
