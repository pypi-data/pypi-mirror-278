class MannWhitneyParity(Supervised):
    """
    Performs a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test to check that the scores of sensitive-attributed nodes (ground truth)
    do not exhibit  higher or lower values compared to the rest. To do this, the test's U statistic is transformed so
    that value 1 indicates that the probability of sensitive-attributed nodes exhibiting higher values is the same as
    for lower values (50%). Value 0 indicates that either the probability of exhibiting only higher or only lower
    values is 100%.
    Known scores correspond to the binary sensitive attribute checking whether nodes are sensitive.
