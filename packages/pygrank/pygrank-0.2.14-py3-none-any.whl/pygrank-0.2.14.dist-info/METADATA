# :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
This library requires Python 3.9 or later. Get the latest version per:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pygrank
```

Also install any of these optional dependencies to use the respective backend: `tensorflow`,`pytorch`,`torch_sparse`,`matvec`

# :brain: Overview

`pygrank` is a collection of node ranking algorithms 
and practices that support real-world conditions, 
such as large graphs and heterogeneous preprocessing 
and postprocessing requirements. Thus, it provides 
ready-to-use tools that simplify the deployment of 
theoretical advancements and testing of new algorithms.
