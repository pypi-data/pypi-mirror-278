        # Comment-based Codebase Refining (COCORF)
        
        ``COCORF`` is a Python3 library for filtering query-appropriate text to build high-quality code search datasets.
        It consists of two filters: a rule-based filer and a model-based filter (Pytorch required).
        Currently, ``COCORF`` should be used with GPU-enabled Pytorch.
        
        ## Installation
        We have uploaded ``COCORF`` to Python Package Index (PyPi) and you can install it by the following command:
        ```
        pip install cocorf
        ```
        
        You can also clone this repo and install directly with the following command:
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Besides, ``COCORF`` should be used with GPU-enabled Pytorch. You can refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to install Pytorch. Pytorch 1.3 is required (Pytorch 1.3 does not support Python 3.8+).
