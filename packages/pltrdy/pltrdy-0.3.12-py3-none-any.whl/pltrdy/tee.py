# tee.py
# Purpose: A Python class with a write() method which, when
# used instead of print() or sys.stdout.write(), for writing
# output, will cause output to go to both sys.stdout and
# the filename passed to the class's constructor. The output
# file is called the teefile in the below comments and code.

# The idea is to do something roughly like the Unix tee command,
# but from within Python code, using this class in your program.

# The teefile will be overwritten if it exists.

# The class also has a writeln() method which is a convenience
# method that adds a newline at the end of each string it writes,
# so that the user does not have to.

# Python's string formatting language is supported (without any
# effort needed in this class), since Python's strings support it,
# not the print method.
