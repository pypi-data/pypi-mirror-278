eds-scikit is a tool to assist data scientists working on the AP-HP's Clinical Data Warehouse. It is specifically targeted for OMOP-standardized data. It main goals are to:

- Ease access and analysis of data
- Allow a better transfer of knowledge between projects
- Improve research reproducibility

## Development

This library is developed and maintained by the core team of AP-HP’s Clinical Data Warehouse (EDS) with the strong support of [Inria's SODA team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/).

## How to use

Please check the [online documentation](https://aphp.github.io/eds-scikit/) for more informations. You will find
- Detailed explanation of the project goal and working principles
- A complete API documentation
- Various Jupyter Notebooks describing how to use various functionnalities of eds-scikit
- And more !
## Requirements
eds-scikit stands on the shoulders of [Spark 2.4](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.8/index.html) which requires:

- Python ~3.7.1
- Java 8
## Installation

You can install eds-scikit via `pip`:

```bash
pip install "eds-scikit[aphp]"
```

:warning: If you get an an error during installation, please try downgrading pip via `pip install -U "pip<23" before install `eds-scikit`

:warning: If you don't work in AP-HP's ecosystem (EDS), please install via:
