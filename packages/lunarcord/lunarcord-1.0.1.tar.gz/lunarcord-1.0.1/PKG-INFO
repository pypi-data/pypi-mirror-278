This package is NOT a discord fork!

- Customizable bot intents
- Sharding and auto-sharding
- Voice gateway - connecting to voice call

Installation

Lunarcord requires **Python 3** or higher.
You can install **Lunarcord** from your terminal:

.. code:: sh

    bot = lunarcord.Bot()

    @bot.slashCommand()
    async def ping(interaction: lunarcord.Interaction):
        """A test ping-pong slash command!"""
        await interaction.send("Pong!")

    bot.run("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")
