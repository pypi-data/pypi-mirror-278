# RunSnakeRun Python Profiler ![RunSnakeRun Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcfletch/runsnakerun/master/docs/pyaccellerate.svg)

RunSnakeRun is a small GUI utility that allows
you to view various (Python 2 or 3) profiler dumps in a sortable
GUI view. 

It allows you to explore the profiler information using
a "square map" visualization or sortable tables of data.

Supported Formats:

* Python PStats Dumps (profile and cProfile modules)
* PySpy's SpeedScope Exports (json files)
* Meliae Memory Dumps (python 2.x only)
* ColdShot profiles (python 2.x only)

## Contributing and Bug Reports

Feel free to open a bug report. Do note that I don't often
get time to work on RunSnakeRun, so it can often take weeks
or months before I reply to an issue. I normally get around
to working on it either when someone is poking me about 
something or I happen to need to do some profiling myself.
