Plotting
========

WindKit provides a number of different plotting functions for you to view and analyze your data. The plots come in two large groups, statistical plots and maps.

Statistical plots use Plotly.js to create interactive plots, while maps are plotted using xarray, but provide some useful convenience tools such as adding overlays.
