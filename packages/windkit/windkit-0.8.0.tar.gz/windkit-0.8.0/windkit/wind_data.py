    This function requires the optional dependencies:
        "zarr", "pystac-client", "planetary-computer", "fsspec", and "adlfs"

    Parameters
    ----------
    datetime : datetime.datetime, str, tuple
        Either a single datetime or datetime range used to filter results.
        If a tuple, it must be a (start, end) tuple of datetime.datetime or timestamps
        as described below.
        You may express a single datetime using a datetime.datetime instance,
        a RFC 3339-compliant timestamp, or a simple date string (see below).
        Instances of datetime.datetime are assumed to be in UTC timezone
        If using a simple date string, the datetime can be specified in YYYY-mm-dd format,
        optionally truncating to YYYY-mm or just YYYY. Simple date strings will be
        expanded to include the entire time period,
        If used in a range, the end of the range expands to the end of that day/month/year.


    bbox : windkit.spatial.BBox, tuple, list, np.ndarray, optional
        Bounding box of the ERA5 data to download. Must be in "EPSG:4326" coordinates.
        If a list, tuple, or np.ndarray is provided, it must be a
        a 1D iterable of [min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat]. By default None, which
        downloads the entire ERA5 grid.

    source : str, optional
        Source from which we download the ERA5 data, by default "planetary_computer"
        Currently only "planetary_computer" is supported

    translate_to_windkit : bool, optional
        If True, translate the ERA5 data to the format used in windkit, by default True

    Returns
    -------
    xr.Dataset
        ERA5 data

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the source is not supported

    Notes
    -----
    The ERA5 data is downloaded from the planetary computer. Read about Microsofts planetary computer here: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/about
