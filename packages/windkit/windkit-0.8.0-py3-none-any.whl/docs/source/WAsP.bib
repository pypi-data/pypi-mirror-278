@article{Deardorff1972,
abstract = {Results of numerical integrations are presented for a neutrally stratified planetary boundary layer containing a passive scalar, and for three unstable cases with upward heat flux. The air is assumed unsaturated. A total of either 16000 or 32000 grid points was used in a three-dimensional region with length and width several times the height of the boundary layer. A key result is the irrelevance of the neutral height scale, u*/f, and its replacement by the height zi of the inversion base which confines the convective mixing when -zi/L is as small as 1.5 (L is the Monin-Obukhov length). Shapes of the eddies are examined for -zi/L=0, 1.5, 4.5 and 45; and only for the two slightly unstable cases were the vertical velocity eddies distinctly elongated as in Ekman-layer theories. At large instabilities it is shown how the friction velocity u* loses its influence upon the turbulence intensities and a convective velocity scale becomes important. Vertical profiles of mean wind, potential temperature, momentum flux, gross eddy coefficients, flux correlation coefficients, turbulence intensities, temperature variance and pressure fluctuations are presented and compared, when possible, with measurements},

@article{Floors2018b,
abstract = {Abstract. Applying erroneous roughness lengths can have a large impact on the estimated performance of wind turbines, particularly in forested areas. In this study, a new method called the objective roughness approach (ORA), which converts tree height maps created using airborne lidar scans to roughness maps suitable for wind modelling, is evaluated via cross predictions among different anemometers at a complex forested site with seven tall meteorological masts using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). The cross predictions were made using ORA maps created at four spatial resolutions and from four freely available roughness maps based on land use classifications. The validation showed that the use of ORA maps resulted in a closer agreement with observational data for all investigated resolutions compared to the land use maps. Further, when using the ORA maps, the risk of making large errors ({\textgreater} 25 {\%}) in predicted power density was reduced by 40–50 {\%} compared to satellite-based products with the same resolution. The results could be further improved for high-resolution ORA maps by adding the displacement height. The improvements when using the ORA maps were both due to a higher roughness length and due to the higher resolution.},
