# Leaspy - LEArning Spatiotemporal Patterns in Python
Leaspy is a software package for the statistical analysis of **longitudinal data**, particularly **medical** data that comes in a form of **repeated observations** of patients at different time-points.

## Get started Leaspy

### Installation

1. Leaspy requires Python >= 3.9, < 3.12
2. Create a dedicated environment (optional):

   Using `conda`
   ```
   conda create --name leaspy python=3.10
   conda activate leaspy
   ```

   Or using `pyenv`
   ```
   pyenv virtualenv leaspy
   pyenv local leaspy
   ```

3. Install leaspy:
`pip install leaspy`

It will automatically install all needed dependencies.

### Examples & Tutorials
The `example/start/` folder contains a starting point if you want to launch your first scripts and notebook with the Leaspy package.
You can find additional walkthroughs in:
- this series of [online tutorials](https://disease-progression-modelling.github.io/pages/notebooks/disease_course_mapping/disease_course_mapping.html) from 2020
- this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@igoroa/analysis-of-longitudinal-data-made-easy-with-leaspy-f8d529fcb5f8) of 2019 (_warning_: the plotter and the individual parameters described there have been deprecated since then)

## Description
Leaspy is a software package for the statistical analysis of **longitudinal data**, particularly **medical** data that comes in a form of **repeated observations** of patients at different time-points.
Considering these series of short-term data, the software aims at :
- recombining them to reconstruct the long-term spatio-temporal trajectory of evolution
- positioning each patient observations relatively to the group-average timeline, in terms of both temporal differences (time shift and acceleration factor) and spatial differences (different sequences of events, spatial pattern of progression, ...)
- quantifying impact of cofactors (gender, genetic mutation, environmental factors, ...) on the evolution of the signal
- imputing missing values
- predicting future observations
- simulating virtual patients to un-bias the initial cohort or mimics its characteristics

The software package can be used with scalar multivariate data whose progression can be modelled by a logistic shape, an exponential decay or a linear progression.
The simplest type of data handled by the software are scalar data: they correspond to one (univariate) or multiple (multivariate) measurement(s) per patient observation.
This includes, for instance, clinical scores, cognitive assessments, physiological measurements (e.g. blood markers, radioactive markers) but also imaging-derived data that are rescaled, for instance, between 0 and 1 to describe a logistic progression.

### Main features
- `fit` : determine the **population parameters** that describe the disease progression at the population level
- `personalize` : determine the **individual parameters** that characterize the individual scenario of biomarker progression
- `estimate` : evaluate the biomarker values of a patient at any age, either for missing value imputation or future prediction
- `simulate` : generate synthetic data from the model
