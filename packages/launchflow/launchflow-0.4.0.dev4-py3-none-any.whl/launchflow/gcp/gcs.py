    Like all [Resources](/docs/concepts/resources), this class configures itself across multiple [Environments](/docs/concepts/environments).

    For more information see [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview).

    ## Example Usage
    ```python
    import launchflow as lf

    # Automatically creates / connects to a GCS Bucket in your GCP project
    gcs = lf.gcp.GCSBucket("my-bucket")

    # Quick utilities for reading and writing file contents
    gcs.upload_from_string("file contents", "path/in/gcs/file.txt")

    # You can also use the google-cloud-storage library directly
    bucket = gcs.bucket()
    bucket.blob("my-file").upload_from_filename("my-file")
    ```

    ## Optional Arguments
    - `location` (str): The location of the bucket. Defaults to "US".

    ```python
    import launchflow as lf

    bucket = lf.gcp.GCSBucket("my-bucket", location="EU")
