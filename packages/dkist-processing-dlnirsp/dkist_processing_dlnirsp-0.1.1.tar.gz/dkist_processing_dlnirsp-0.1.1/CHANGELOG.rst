v0.1.1 (2024-06-12)
===================

Misc
----

- Bump `dkist-fits-specifications` to v4.3.0. We need this in DL-NIRSP so some dither-related keywords are no longer required.
  (They are only present if dithering is used). (`#6 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-dlnirsp/pull-requests/6>`__)


v0.1.0 (2024-06-06)
===================

- Initial release. Mostly for first release to DC stacks (i.e., not "production" quality).
