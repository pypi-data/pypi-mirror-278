# G-Look: Auto EDA

glook is a Python library that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (Auto EDA). With glook, you can easily visualize and analyze your dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships.

## ⚠️ **BEFORE INSTALLATION** ⚠️

**Before installing glook, it's strongly recommended to create a new Python environment to avoid potential conflicts with your current environment.**


## Creating a New Conda Environment

To create a new conda environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda**:
   If you don't have conda installed, you can download and install it from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

2. **Open a Anaconda Prompt**:
   Open a Anaconda Prompt (or Anaconda Terminal) on your system.

3. **Create a New Environment**:
   To create a new conda environment, use the following command. Replace `my_env_name` with your desired environment name.
- Support Python versions are > 3.8
```bash
conda create --name my_env_name python=3.8
```

4. **Activate the Environment**:
    After creating the environment, activate it with the following command:
```bash
conda activate my_env_name
```

## OR
## Create a New Virtual Environment with `venv`
If you prefer using Python's built-in `venv` module, here's how to create a virtual environment:

1. **Check Your Python Installation**:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:
   - Support Python versions are > 3.8
```bash
python --version
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
Use the following command to create a new virtual environment. Replace `my_env_name` with your desired environment name.
```bash
python -m venv my_env_name
```

3. **Activate the Environment**:
After creating the virtual environment, activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system:
```bash
my_env_name\Scripts\activate
```

## Installation

You can install glook using pip:

```bash
pip install glook
```

## Usage

Once installed, glook can be launched globally from the command line. Simply type `glook` and press enter to start the application.

```bash
glook
```

The glook application GUI will launch, allowing you to perform Auto EDA on your dataset interactively.
