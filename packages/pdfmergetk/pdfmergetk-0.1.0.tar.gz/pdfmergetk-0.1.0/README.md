> [!IMPORTANT]
> * **Windows** : The executable EXE is generated using [`pyinstaller`](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/), it is possible that when downloading and/or running this executable, the antivirus you are using detects it as a virus, but it is because it is a **false positive**, [review `pyinstaller` developer notes](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/develop/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/antivirus.md). If you have any problems running this program, it should be added to the <u>*antivirus exception list*</u> and it would be helpful to this project if you **report it as false positive** to the antivirus company you use.
> * **Linux** : did not file any reports on virustotal.com.
