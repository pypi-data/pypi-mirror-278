# Phi-3-Vision VLM Model for Apple MLX: An All-in-One Port

This project brings the powerful phi-3-vision VLM to Apple's MLX framework, offering a comprehensive solution for various text and image processing tasks. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, this implementation offers a straightforward and minimalistic integration of the VLM model. It seamlessly incorporates essential functionalities such as generating quantized model weights, optimizing KV cache quantization during inference, facilitating LoRA/QLoRA training, and conducting model benchmarking, all encapsulated within a single file for convenient access and usage.

## Key Features

* **Su-scaled RoPE:** Implements Su-scaled Rotary Position Embeddings to manage sequences of up to 128K tokens.
* **Batch Generation:** Accelerate inference by generating text for multiple prompts concurrently (94 tokens-per-sec batched vs 51 tokens-per-sec single)
* **Cache Quantization:** Optimize inference for processing long contexts with key-value cache quantization (5.3s quantized vs 5.1s original).
* **Model Quantization:** Reduce model size for faster loading and deployment (2.3GB quantized vs 8.5GB original).
* **Chat Template:** Utilization of chat template for streamlining interactions with the model.
* **LoRA Training:** Easily customize the model for specific tasks or datasets using LoRA.
* **Benchmarking:** To quickly assess model performance on any dataset. (WIP)
* **VLM Agent:** Leverages VLM's visual understanding for interactive code generation and refinement, enabling data visualization and image manipulation through a visual feedback loop. (WIP)
