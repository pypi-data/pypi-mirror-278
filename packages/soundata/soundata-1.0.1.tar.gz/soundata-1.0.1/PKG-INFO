This library provides tools for working with common sound datasets, including tools for:
* Downloading datasets to a common location and format
* Validating that the files for a dataset are all present 
* Loading annotation files to a common format
* Parsing clip-level metadata for detailed evaluations

Here's soundata's [list of currently supported datasets](https://soundata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/quick_reference.html).

### Installation

To install, simply run:

```python
pip install soundata
```

### Quick example
```python
import soundata

dataset = soundata.initialize('urbansound8k')
dataset.download()  # download the dataset
dataset.validate()  # validate that all the expected files are there

example_clip = dataset.choice_clip()  # choose a random example clip
print(example_clip)  # see the available data

```
See the [documentation](https://soundata.readthedocs.io/) for more examples and the API reference.


### Contributing a new dataset loader

We welcome and encourage contributions to this library, especially new dataset loaders. Please see [contributing](https://soundata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/contributing.html) for guidelines. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/soundata/soundata/issues) if you have any doubt or your run into problems when working on the library.


### Citing


```
TBA
```


When working with datasets, please cite the version of `soundata` that you are using **AND** include the reference of the dataset, which can be found in the respective dataset loader using the `cite()` method.
