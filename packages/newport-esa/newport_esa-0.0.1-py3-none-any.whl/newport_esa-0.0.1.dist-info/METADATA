# newport-esa
A Python API for the Newport Model ESA-C Ultra-Resolution Actuator Controller.

## Overview
The source code and example scripts have been tested using Python 3.8.10 running in Windows 7.

## Requirements

## Installation
1. `pip install newport-esa`

## Windows 7 Compatibility
Due to PC hardware limitations, initial development for this package was performed using the
Windows 7 (64-bit) operating system.

The following programs, applications, and drivers were successfully used for package development in Windows 7 (64-bit):

1. Python 3.8.10
2. pip 24.0
3. Git 2.45.2
4. NI-VISA 14.0.0
5. NI-VISA Runtime 14.0.0
6. NI-488.2 14.0
7. NI-488.2 Runtime 14.0
8. PyCharm 2019.3.5 (Community Edition)
9. Notepad++ 8.6.8

In principle, the text editor and IDE (Notepad++ and PyCharm) are not explicitly critical to the success of the package.
All other programs, applications, and drivers listed are critical to the success of the package on Windows 7.

A file named `requirements-win7.txt` is included with the project with an output of the installed packages
that were tested successfully in Windows 7 (64-bit).


## Usage
There are a number of examples in the `examples` directory that can help you get up and running.
