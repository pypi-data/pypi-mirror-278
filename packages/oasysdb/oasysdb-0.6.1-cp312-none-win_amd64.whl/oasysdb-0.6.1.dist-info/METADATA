# üëã Meet OasysDB

OasysDB is a flexible and easy-to-use vector database written in Rust. It is designed with simplicity in mind to help you focus on building your AI application without worrying about database setup and configuration.

With 3 different runtime modes, OasysDB will accompany you throughout your journey from the early stages of development to scaling up your AI application for production workloads.

- **Embedded**: Run OasysDB directly inside your application.
- **Hosted**: Run OasysDB as a standalone server. _Coming soon_
- **Distributed**: Run sharded OasysDB instances. _Coming not so soon_ üòâ

## Use Cases

OasysDB is very flexible! You can use it for almost any systems related with vector search such as:

- Local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline with an LLM and embedding model to generate a context-aware output.
- Image similarity search engine to find similar images based on their semantic content. [See Python demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15_1hH7jGKzMeQ6IfnScjsc-iJRL5XyL7?usp=sharing).
- Real-time product recommendation system to suggest similar products based on the product features or user preferences.
- **Add your use case here** üòÅ

## Features

### Core Features

üî∏ **Embedded Database**: Zero setup and no dedicated server or process required.

üî∏ **Optional Persistence**: In-memory vector collections that can be persisted to disk.

üî∏ **Incremental Ops**: Insert, modify, and delete vectors without rebuilding indexes.

üî∏ **Flexible Schema**: Store additional and flexible metadata for each vector record.

### Technical Features

üîπ **Fast HNSW**: Efficient and accurate vector search with state-of-the-art algorithm.

üîπ **Configurable Metric**: Use Euclidean or Cosine distance depending on your use-case.

üîπ **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded & SIMD-optimized vector distance calculation.

üîπ **Built-in vector ID**: No headache record management with guaranteed ID uniqueness.

# üöÄ Quickstart with Rust

![Rust-Banner.png](https://i.postimg.cc/NMCwFBPd/Rust-Banner.png)

To get started with OasysDB in Rust, you need to add `oasysdb` to your `Cargo.toml`. You can do so by running the command below which will add the latest version of OasysDB to your project.

```bash
cargo add oasysdb
```

After that, you can use the code snippet below as a reference to get started with OasysDB. In short, use `Collection` to store your vector records or search similar vector and use `Database` to persist a vector collection to the disk.

```rust
use oasysdb::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Vector dimension must be uniform.
    let dimension = 128;

    // Replace with your own data.
    let records = Record::many_random(dimension, 100);

    let mut config = Config::default();

    // Optionally set the distance function. Default to Euclidean.
    config.distance = Distance::Cosine;

    // Create a vector collection.
    let collection = Collection::build(&config, &records).unwrap();

    // Optionally save the collection to persist it.
    let mut db = Database::new("data/test").unwrap();
    db.save_collection("vectors", &collection).unwrap();

    // Search for the nearest neighbors.
    let query = Vector::random(dimension);
    let result = collection.search(&query, 5).unwrap();

    for res in result {
        let (id, distance) = (res.id, res.distance);
        println!("{distance:.5} | ID: {id}");
    }
}
```

## Feature Flags

OasysDB provides several feature flags to enable or disable certain features. You can do this by adding the feature flags to your project `Cargo.toml` file. Below are the available feature flags and their descriptions:

- `json`: Enables easy Serde's JSON conversion from and to the metadata type. This feature is very useful if you have a complex metadata type or if you use APIs that communicate using JSON.

- `gen`: Enables the vector generator trait and modules to extract vector embeddings from your contents using OpenAI or other embedding models. This feature allows OasysDB to handle vector embedding extraction for you without separate dependencies.

# üöÄ Quickstart with Python

![Python-Banner.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rp1qjBZJ/Python-Banner.png)

OasysDB also provides a Python binding which allows you to add it directly to your project. You can install the Python library of OasysDB by running the command below:

```bash
pip install oasysdb
```

This command will install the latest version of OasysDB to your Python environment. After you're all set with the installation, you can use the code snippet below as a reference to get started with OasysDB in Python.

```python
from oasysdb.prelude import *


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Open the database.
    db = Database("data/example")

    # Replace with your own records.
    records = Record.many_random(dimension=128, len=100)

    # Create a vector collection.
    config = Config.create_default()
    collection = Collection.from_records(config, records)

    # Optionally, persist the collection to the database.
    db.save_collection("my_collection", collection)

    # Replace with your own query.
    query = Vector.random(128)

    # Search for the nearest neighbors.
    result = collection.search(query, n=5)

    # Print the result.
    print("Nearest neighbors ID: {}".format(result[0].id))
```

# üéØ Benchmarks

OasysDB uses a built-in benchmarking suite using Rust's [Criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion) crate which we use to measure the performance of the vector database.

Currently, the benchmarks are focused on the performance of the collection's vector search functionality. We are working on adding more benchmarks to measure the performance of other operations.

If you are curious and want to run the benchmarks, you can use the command below to run the benchmarks. If you do run it, please share the results with us üòâ

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Memory Usage

OasysDB uses HNSW which is known to be a memory hog compared to other indexing algorithms. We decided to use it because of its performance even when storing large datasets of vectors with high dimension.

If you are curious about the memory usage of OasysDB, you can use the command below to run the memory usage measurement script. You can tweak the parameters in the `examples/measure-memory.rs` file to see how the memory usage changes.

```bash
cargo run --example measure-memory
```

## Recall Rate

In vector databases, recall is the percentage of relevant items that are successfully retrieved compared to the true set of relevant items also known as the ground truth.

To measure the recall rate, you can use the command below to run the recall rate measurement script. You can tweak the parameters in the `examples/measure-recall.rs` to see how OasysDB performs under different requirements.

```bash
cargo run --example measure-recall
```

Note: This script uses random vector records to measure the recall rate. This might not represent the real-world performance of OasysDB with proper datasets.
