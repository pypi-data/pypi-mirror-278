-00:00:06,843 --> -00:00:02,850
I always wanted to leave my country
and go somewhere else.

2
-00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:00,946
I always wanted to come to France.

3
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:03,364
So, one day when I was 17, I left.

4
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:06,626
There I was in Paris.

5
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:13,736
Since I was a bit naive,

6
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:18,541
everyone seemed beautiful
and fabulous.

7
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:23,180
<i>I couldn't tell cruelty from kindness.</i>

8
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:27,653
<i>For me, people were</i>
<i>the way they were.</i>

9
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:31,619
<i>You just worked with them</i>
<i>or talked with them.</i>

10
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:35,896
Obviously, it was a big shock.
