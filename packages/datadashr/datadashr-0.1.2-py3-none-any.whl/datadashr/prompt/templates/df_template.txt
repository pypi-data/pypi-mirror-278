Given a DataFrame named 'df' of {{ num_rows }} rows and {{ num_columns }} columns,
The dataframe is present in the variable 'df'.
Its columns are the following:

{% for col, col_type in columns %}
- {{ col }} ({{ col_type }})
{% endfor %}

I want you to solve the following problem:
write a Python code snippet that addresses the following request:
{{ request }}

While crafting the code, please follow these guidelines:
1. When comparing or searching for strings, use lower case letters, ignore case sensitivity, and apply a "contains" search.
2. Ensure that the answer is a single line of code without explanations, comments, or additional details.
3. If a single line solution is not possible, multiline solutions or functions are acceptable, but the code must end with an assignment to the variable 'result'.
4. Assign the resulting code to the variable 'result'.
5. df is present in the variable 'df' not add it to the code.
6. Avoid importing any additional libraries other than pandas and numpy.
7. Return the code encapsulated within triple backticks, as shown below:

\`\`\`python
<code>
\`\`\`

Also:
{{ custom_prompt }}
