vulcan_utils/printable.py

This module defines the Printable class, a mixin that enhances any class with
automatic, detailed string representations of its instances. By inheriting from
Printable, other classes can provide meaningful __str__ and __repr__ methods
without additional coding. These methods generate string outputs that include
all instance variables, making it easier to visualize object states during
debugging and logging.

class Printable:
    """
    A mixin class that provides a default implementation for printable representations
    of objects. This class overrides the __repr__ and __str__ methods to return
    a string representation of all attributes of an instance.

    The mixin can be inherited by other classes to automatically equip them with
    readable string representations that include all instance variables.

        Returns a string in which each instance variable is represented as a key-value pair.
