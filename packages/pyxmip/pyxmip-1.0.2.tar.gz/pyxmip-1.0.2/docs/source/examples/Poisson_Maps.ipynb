    "In the pyXMIP package, a special reduction procedure (called ``PoissonPointReduction``) can be used during match reduction. The idea behind this reduction is that, for some object types and databases, there is a chance that (within a given radius) a match to such an object could occur randomly. This probability, which is Poisson distributed, is critical for correctly identifying spurious matches, but it can be difficult to get. In this notebook, we're going to walk through all the ins and outs of Poisson Mapping; the process pyXMIP uses to obtain those probabilities.\n",
