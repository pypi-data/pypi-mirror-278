pyXMIP (the **p**\ ython **X**\ -**M**\ atching and **I**\ dentification **P**\ ackage) is an astronomical software package for cross referencing source catalogs
against known databases. The package provides a variety of statistical tools for quantifying the confidence of a given match and automates
queries against many of the most common astronomical databases.


Features
========

- Cross match catalogs of sources from survey missions against a wide array of known source databases.
- Use statistical methodologies to model the distribution of sources and produce match probabilities.

Documentation
=============

|docs|

The documentation for ``pyXMIP`` is hosted `here <https://eliza-diggins.github.io/pyXMIP>`_. It includes various example
notebooks, a complete API documentation and further information. It also includes guides on custom code implementations to
meet your science goals.

Installation
============

``pyXMIP`` may be installed from PyPI (stable versions) as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    >>> pip install pyxmip

To install ``pyXMIP`` from source, you need only clone the git repository

.. code-block:: shell

    >>> git clone https://www.github.com/eliza-diggins/pyXMIP

and then install using

.. code-block:: shell

    >>> cd pyXMIP
    >>> pip install .

You can also achieve this in one line using

.. code-block:: shell

    >>> pip install git+https://www.github.com/eliza-diggins/pyXMIP.git
