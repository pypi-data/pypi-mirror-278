# This file contains a list of pixels to be added to the bad pixel mask. This
# list can be used as a catch-all to be sure that known bad pixels which may
# not be found using the bad pixel search algorithms are still flagged.
#
# Note that entries in the x and y columns can be single numbers, or a range
# of pixels (e.g. 350:352). When a range is given in this way, the values are
# assumed to be INCLUSIVE, so 350:352 means that rows 350, 351 AND 352 will be
# flagged. This is slightly different from python's convention of stopping
# one short of the second index in a range. The code also supports python-like
# behavior where the starting or ending value can be omitted, and the code
# will then extend the range to 0 or the maximum index number, respectively.
# e.g.  2030:   will flag all rows from 2030 to the end
#       :10     will flag all rows from 0 to 10 (inclusive)
#        :      will flag all rows
#
# Note that coordinates are assumed to be in a 0-indexed coordinate system.
#
# Flag values must be strings that match those in the jwst calibration
# pipeline's list of bad pixel types. Values are not case sensitive.
#
# This is a list of bad pixels for the MIRI imaging detector
