# sqlfluff-common-conventions

An SQLFluff plugin for rules that enforce common SQL naming conventions.

As of 12 June 2024, all rules are compatible with the following dialects:

- [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)
- [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

All rules are also compatible with the following naming cases:

- snake_case
- dromedaryCase (also known as lowerCamelCase or simply camelCase)
- PascalCase (also known as upperCamelCase or simply CamelCase)

## Rules

- CC01: Start boolean columns with `is` or `has`.
- CC02: End datetime, time, and timestamp columns with `at`.
- CC03: End date columns with `date`.
- CC04: Only allow a list of configurable strings to be used in identifiers.
- CC05: Block a list of configurable strings from being used in identifiers.
- CC06: Ensure column and table names match a given regex.
