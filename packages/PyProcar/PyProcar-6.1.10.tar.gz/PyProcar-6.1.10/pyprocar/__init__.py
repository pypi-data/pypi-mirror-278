# TODO change all n* variables to n_* variable (norbital to n_orbital)
# TODO remove importing skimage, pyvista, trimesh, matplotlib, numpy, and seekpath. It is not needed here
# TODO create a function in utils that does ProcarFileFilter
# TODO create a directory named _old to move all of the old functionalities there. need to pass all of the old tests

# TODO using * in import is not a good way, because 1. you don't know what's being imported, 2. the code looses it's organization @Logan
