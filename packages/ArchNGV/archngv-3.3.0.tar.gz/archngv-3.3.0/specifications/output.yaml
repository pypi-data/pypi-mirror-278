      Microdomains are convex polygons representing the available bounding region for each
      astrocyte. Each polygon is reresented as a collection of points linked together via
      triangles. In addition, each microdomain has access to its adjacent neighbors. Their size
      is n_astrocytes, i.e. one per astrocyte.

      SONATA node population of the vasculature's geometry. This representation is essential
      for the gliovascular edges that require a target node population. The vasculature is stored
      as an EdgePopulation of the geometrical segments (flat edges, not organized in sections)
      comprising the vascular morphology. Thus, the id of the EdgePopulation corresponds to the
      i-th edge in the vascular morphogy. In order, to maintain the mapping between the edge
      representation and the section/segment one, the section and segment ids for each edge are
      stored so that the section representation can be uniquely reconstructed if needed.

      Neuroglial connectivity. Astrocytes establish tripartite connections with synapses, wrapping
      around them forming a three-way ensemble. There are four distrinct elements in a tripartite
      connection, the astrocyte, the synapse, and the pre and post synaptic neurons. In sonata an
      edge corresponds to a connection between an astrocyte, a synapse and its post-synaptic neuron.
      The pre-synaptic neuron, although not directly accessible, it can be retrieved via the syna-
      ptic connectivity using the synapse id. The synapse id is stored as a property on the edges.
