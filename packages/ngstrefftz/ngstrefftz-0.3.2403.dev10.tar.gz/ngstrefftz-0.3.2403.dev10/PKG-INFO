NGSTrefftz provides a framework to implement Trefftz finite element spaces for NGSolve, with several Trefftz spaces already implemented. Additionally, Trefftz-DG on tent-pitched meshes for the acoustic wave equation is implemented using meshes provided by ngstents. Furthermore, the package includes an implementation of the embedded Trefftz method.
