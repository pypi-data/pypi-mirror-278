# MuNG

The ``mung`` (**Mu**sic **N**otation **G**raph) package implements a graph representation
 of music notation that is especially amenable to Optical Music Recognition (OMR).
It was used for instance in the [MUSCIMA++](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/muscima) dataset of music notation.

Requires Python >= 3.6 and was tested with Python 3.11.


## Getting started

1. Install this package: ``pip install mung``
2. Download the [MUSCIMA++ dataset](https://github.com/OMR-Research/muscima-pp).
3. Run through the [tutorial](https://muscima.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial.html#tutorial).

Fundamentally, the Music Notatation Graph is a very simple construct:

It stores the primitives that can be detected by a [Music Object Detector](https://github.com/apacha/MusicObjectDetector-TF)
as nodes and then store the relations between those nodes. But the devil is
in the details. To better understand what kind of [relations are useful](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000006.pdf) 
and which kind of relations are stored for common western music notation, check out the
[annotator instruction from MUSCIMarker](https://muscimarker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructions.html).



## Dataset
The dataset itself is available for download

### Introduction to MUSCIMA++ Video

Watch Jan give a 30 minute introduction into this dataset on YouTube, which explains many design decisions and thoughts that directly affected the creation of the MuNG format:
