# Assess genome annotations using structure databases with Prost5

Structural databases for protein sequences are invaluable tools for informing the validity of gene predictions from annotations.

Currently, generating structures for all genes at the level of eukaryotic genomes is computationally challenging.

Recent advances in transformer representations of amino acid sequences using the ProstT5 ...
