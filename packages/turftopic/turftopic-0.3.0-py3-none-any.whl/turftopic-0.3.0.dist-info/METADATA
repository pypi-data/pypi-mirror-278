 <b>Topic modeling is your turf too.</b> <br> <i> Contextual topic models with representations from transformers. </i></p>


## Intentions
 - Provide simple, robust and fast implementations of existing approaches (BERTopic, Top2Vec, CTM) with minimal dependencies.
 - Implement state-of-the-art approaches from my papers. (papers work-in-progress)
 - Put all approaches in a broader conceptual framework.
 - Provide clear and extensive documentation about the best use-cases for each model.
 - Make the models' API streamlined and compatible with topicwizard and scikit-learn.
 - Develop smarter, transformer-based evaluation metrics.

!!!This package is still a prototype, and no papers are published about the models. Until these are out, and most features are implemented
I DO NOT recommend using this package for production and academic use!!!

## Roadmap
 - [x] Model Implementation
 - [x] Pretty Printing
 - [x] Implement visualization utilites for these models in topicwizard
 - [x] Thorough documentation
 - [x] Dynamic modeling (currently `GMM` and `ClusteringTopicModel` others might follow)
 - [ ] Publish papers :hourglass_flowing_sand: (in progress..)
 - [ ] High-level topic descriptions with LLMs.
 - [ ] Contextualized evaluation metrics.


## Basics [(Documentation)](https://x-tabdeveloping.github.io/turftopic/)
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/x-tabdeveloping/turftopic/blob/main/examples/basic_example_20newsgroups.ipynb)

### Installation

Turftopic can be installed from PyPI.

```bash
pip install turftopic
```

If you intend to use CTMs, make sure to install the package with Pyro as an optional dependency.

```bash
pip install turftopic[pyro-ppl]
```

### Fitting a Model

Turftopic's models follow the scikit-learn API conventions, and as such they are quite easy to use if you are familiar with
scikit-learn workflows.

Here's an example of how you use KeyNMF, one of our models on the 20Newsgroups dataset from scikit-learn.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(
    subset="all",
    remove=("headers", "footers", "quotes"),
)
corpus = newsgroups.data
```

Turftopic also comes with interpretation tools that make it easy to display and understand your results.

```python
from turftopic import KeyNMF

model = KeyNMF(20).fit(corpus)
```

### Interpreting Models

Turftopic comes with a number of pretty printing utilities for interpreting the models.

To see the highest the most important words for each topic, use the `print_topics()` method.

```python
model.print_topics()
```

| Topic ID | Top 10 Words                                                                                    |

```python

model.print_representative_documents(0, corpus, document_topic_matrix)
```

### Visualization

Turftopic does not come with built-in visualization utilities, [topicwizard](https://github.com/x-tabdeveloping/topicwizard), an interactive topic model visualization library, is compatible with all models from Turftopic.

```bash
pip install topic-wizard
```

By far the easiest way to visualize your models for interpretation is to launch the topicwizard web app.

```python
import topicwizard

topicwizard.visualize(corpus, model=model)
```

<figure>
  <img src="https://x-tabdeveloping.github.io/topicwizard/_images/screenshot_topics.png" width="70%" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
  <figcaption>Screenshot of the topicwizard Web Application</figcaption>
</figure>

Alternatively you can use the [Figures API](https://x-tabdeveloping.github.io/topicwizard/figures.html) in topicwizard for individual HTML figures.

## Models

| Model | Description | Usage |
| - | - | - |
| KeyNMF | Non-negative Matrix Factorization enhanced with keyword extraction using sentence embeddings | `model = KeyNMF(n_components=10).fit(corpus)` |
| GMM | Gaussian Mixture Model over contextual embeddings + post-hoc term importance estimation | `model = GMM(n_components=10).fit(corpus)` |
| S³ | Separates semantic signals, aka. axes of semantics in a corpus using independent component analysis. | `model = SemanticSignalSeparation(n_components=10).fit(corpus)` |
| Autoencoding Models | Learn topics using amortized variational inference enhanced by contextual representations.  | `model = AutoEncodingTopicModel(n_components=10, combined=False).fit(corpus)` |
| Clustering Models | Clusters semantic embeddings, and estimates term importances for clusters.  | `model = ClusteringTopicModel(feature_importance="ctfidf").fit(corpus)` |
