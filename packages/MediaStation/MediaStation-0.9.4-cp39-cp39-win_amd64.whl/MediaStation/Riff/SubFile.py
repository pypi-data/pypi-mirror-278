## A single RIFF-style subfile inside a Media Station data file.
## All subfiles follow this beginning structure:
## - RIFF
##  - IMTSrate (always 4 bytes of data)
##  - LIST
##   - data[fourcc] (e.g. "dataigod" or "dataa000")
##   - [fourcc] (e.g. "igod" or "a000")
##   - [fourcc]
##   - ...
## The real data is stored in the subchunks of the LIST chunk - the "data chunks".
##
## Each of these subfiles are *almost* RIFF files but for one exception:
##  - Some FourCCs are not four characters long; they are actually 8 characters long.
##    The strings "IMTSrate" and "dataigod" are the most common 8-character FourCCs.
##    These cannot be LIST-like structures because there is no size between the 
##    two FourCCs as would be expected for a LIST structure.
