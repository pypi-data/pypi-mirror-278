def exprel(x):
  """
  Relative error exponential, ``(exp(x) - 1)/x``.

  When ``x`` is near zero, ``exp(x)`` is near 1, so the numerical calculation of ``exp(x) - 1`` can
  suffer from catastrophic loss of precision. ``exprel(x)`` is implemented to avoid the loss of
  precision that occurs when ``x`` is near zero.

  Args:
    x: ndarray. Input array. ``x`` must contain real numbers.

  Returns:
    ``(exp(x) - 1)/x``, computed element-wise.
