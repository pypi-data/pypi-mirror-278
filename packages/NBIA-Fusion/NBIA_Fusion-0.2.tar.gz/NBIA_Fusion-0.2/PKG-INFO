# MMP-CloudPointFusion

This project is about fusing several ply files into a single one. It provides a function process_point_clouds that performs fusion by tracking and registration, cropping, and processing on the result poit cloud.

Function Description
The process_point_clouds function performs the following steps:

1. Loads a sequence of point clouds from a specified path.
2. Performs tracking processing on the sequence (resgister with the pose estimated by the tracker).
3. Crops the background of each point cloud using bbox_w_rack coordinates.
4. Aligns the point clouds using a RANSAC and ICP.
5. Crops the rack from the aligned point cloud using bbox_wo_rack coordinates.
6. Clean the result

Here is an example of how to use the process_point_clouds function:

In this example, the function is called with the following parameters:

```python

display=True: # This will display the point clouds at each step of the process.

bbox_w_rack=(-0.75, 0.75, -0.50, 0.5, -1.25, 0.4):  # These are the bounding box coordinates for cropping the point clouds with the rack. (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max)

bbox_wo_rack=(-0.75, 0.75, -0.50, 0.5, -1.25, 0.1):  # These are the bounding box coordinates for cropping the point clouds without the rack. (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max)

src_directory="MMP-CloudPointFusion/exemple_bidon":  # This is the path to the directory containing the point cloud files.

destination="":  # This is the path to the directory where the result will be saved. In this case, the point clouds will be saved in the current directory.

# exemple with display flag on
process_point_clouds(
    display=True,
    bbox_w_rack=(-0.75, 0.75, -0.50, 0.5, -1.25, 0.4),
    bbox_wo_rack=(-0.75, 0.75, -0.50, 0.5, -1.25, 0.1),
    src_directory="MMP-CloudPointFusion/exemple_bidon",
    destination="",
)
