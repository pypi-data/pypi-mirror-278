	Comment: She is a very nice person but a horrible teacher. You can follow the syllabus and never know what is going on in class. She assigns 5 page single spaced papers and makes them due within a week. Her grading is very vague, your paper may be better than your last but get a lower grade.

	Comment: She is very nice. The project that you do is very useful. You can never come to class and know what you are supposed to have done or what you will do. She does not use her syllabus, you are assigned assignments that are large and due by the next class period with no warning.

The classes are small so you can personally engage with students and professors, there are thousands of unique clubs to join, and social life is incredible. There are so many unique classes and professors are genuinely passionate about what they do. You will be a part of the family and have connections forever.
