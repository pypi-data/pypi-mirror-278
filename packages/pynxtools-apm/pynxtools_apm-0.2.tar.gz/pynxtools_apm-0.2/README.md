# A parser and normalizer for atom probe tomography and field-ion microscopy data

# Installation
It is recommended to use python 3.11 with a dedicated virtual environment for this package.
Learn how to manage [python versions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and
[virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

This package is a reader plugin for [`pynxtools`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools) and thus should be installed together with `pynxtools`:
```shell
pip install pynxtools[apm]
```

for the latest development version.

# Purpose
This reader plugin for [`pynxtools`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools) is used to translate diverse file formats from the scientific community and technology partners
within the field of atom probe tomography and field-ion microscopy into a standardized representation using the
[NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) application definition [NXapm](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/contributed_definitions/NXapm.html#nxapm).

## Supported file formats
This plugin supports the majority of the file formats that are currently used for atom probe.
A detailed summary is available in the [reference section of the documentation](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/pynxtools-apm).

# Getting started
[A getting started tutorial](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools-apm/tree/main/examples) is offered that guides you
how to use the apm reader for converting your data to NeXus using a Jupyter notebook. That notebook details also the commands how to convert data via command line calls. Note that not every combination of input from a supported file format and other, typically electronic lab notebook, input for the parser allows filling the required and recommended fields and attributes of the NXapm application definition.
Therefore, you may need to provide an ELN file that contains the missing values in order for the
validation step of the APM reader to pass.

# Contributing
We are continously working on adding parsers for other data formats, technology partners, and atom probers.
If you would like to implement a parser for your data, feel free to get in contact.

## Development install
Install the package with its dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools-apm.git --branch main --recursive pynxtools_apm
cd pynxtools_apm
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

<!---There is also a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) available
which formats the code and checks the linting before actually commiting.
It can be installed with
```shell
pre-commit install
```
from the root of this repository.

## Development Notes-->

## Test this software
Especially relevant for developers, there exists a basic test framework written in
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) which can be used as follows:

```shell
python -m pytest -sv tests
```
