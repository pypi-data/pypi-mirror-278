Python SUPLA device library
===========================

A python library allowing you to write a script that acts as a SUPLA device, such as a sensor or a
light switch.

Can be installed from PyPi using `pip install pysupladevice`

Currently supports the following kinds of channel:
 * Relay/switch
 * Temperature sensor
 * Humidity sensor

Note: I am not affiliated with SUPLA or Zamel -- this is not an "official" library.
