class PriorCalculator:

	"""
    This class is used as a calculator of prior probabilities of models using KDEs, it is implemented calculating
	nested probabilities for que parameters passed in, for example, if tuples of the parameters (p0, p1, p2), are
	passed inthe priors returned are simply P(q0) * P(q1 | q0) * P(q2 | q1, q0), where each of this probabilities
	is calculated with a KDE inside bins of previous parameters, in this example, P(q0) is just the value of q0 in
	the total KDE of p0, but P(q1 | q0) is the value of q1 in the KDE calculated inside a bin p0, the same for
	P(q2 | q1, q0), it's calculated inside a bin of p0 and p1. (The normalization method is up to the user to choose)

    In the contructor, the calculator receives the bins that you want to use on the calculation and a bandwidth_factor
	(bw) to be used on the KDEs. It's optional to the user to instead of passing in the bins, constructing them via
	the method self.regular_bins(...) which, as the name sugests, creates N bins of equal size in the given	range for
	every parameter.

		'''
		This method is used to fill the self.prior_bins tensor with KDE vectors that

		(This is a generalization of the process of calculating KDEs inside bins of 
		previous parameters.)

		How it works
		------------

			The cells (c[0], ..., c[n-1]) have two properties, a controlling index
			(STATE) and a list (STORAGE), they are used to construct the tensor that
			contains the KDE vectors.

			A cell is said to be FULL when it's STATE reaches the length of the bin set
			of the corresponding parameter.

			The local reference array is defined in such a way that the element i is
			a restricted version of the element in i - 1 (in practice, every new element
			is the previous but reduced to the data contained on the current bin).

			We first shall initialize cells with STATE = 0 and empty STORAGE (= []),
			one for each parameter that has bins.

			> Start a KDE vector with the kde for p0 (which is independent of bins) 

			> For every other parameter, starting from p1, with the last local reference,
			take it's intersection with the current bin of the previous parameter. Add this
			new reference to the local references and use it to calculate the KDE for
			the current parameter. Add the KDE to the vector.

			> Add the complete KDE vector to the STORAGE of the last cell.

			> For every cell, biginning from the last, if the cell is FULL, set it's
			STATE back to 0 and put it's STORAGE inside the STORAGE of the cell to it's left.

			> If the cell is not FUll yet, up it's STATE by 1;

			When cell[0] is FULL the program is over, the tensor is it's STORAGE.

		Parameters
    	----------
		cols: list[str]
			Name of the columns with the parameters (in order) that
			are going to be used.
