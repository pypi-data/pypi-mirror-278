Print colored strings in curses windows easily

The problem
-----------
There's no way to print pre-formatted, colored terminal text into curses.
If you're printing '\033[94m Blue', which in regular bash terminal is a nice-blue text,
in curses, it will be printed as '^[[94m Blue'

Solution
--------
Use culour (pronounced 'cooler') to print the colored strings onto your curses window.
Instead of using:
```python
window.addstr("colored string")
```
Simply use;
```python
import culour
culour.addstr(window, "colored string")
```

And your string will be added to the screen nice and colored.

To print to a specific place in the screen, use:
```python
culour.addstr(window, y, x, "colored string")
```

Don't forget to initialize the color usage in your curses window by calling ```curses.start_color()``` immediately after ```curses.initscr()```
