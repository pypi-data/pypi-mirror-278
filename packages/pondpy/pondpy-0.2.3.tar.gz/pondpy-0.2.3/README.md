# Introduction
**pondpy** is a package built to aid in the design of low-slope roof bays for 
ponding stability and impounded rain loading. It utilizes a series of
purpose-built finite element and ponding analysis classes and methods to be
as intuitive as possible for the modern engineer.

### Installation
Install pondpy with pip:
```bash
pip install pondpy
```

### Usage
The PondPyModel class is designed to work with several purpose-built classes
that help the user organize their input into a form that are readily utilized
to build and analyze the model. These are the ```PrimaryFraming```,
```SecondaryFraming```, and ```Loading``` classes. In addition, the package is
designed to work with the ```steelpy``` and ```joistpy``` packages, though any
object containing the requiring information attribures (i.e. moment of inertia,
cross-sectional area, elastic modulus, etc.) could be used in lieu of either
package.

To create and analyze a roof bay model, first import the required dependencies
and classes:
```python
from joistpy import sji
from steelpy import aisc

from pondpy.analysis.fem_analysis import (
    SteelBeamSize,
    SteelJoistSize,
)

from pondpy.analysis.pond_analysis import (
    PrimaryMember,
    PrimaryFraming,
    SecondaryMember,
    SecondaryFraming,
    Loading
)

from pondpy.pondpy import PondPyModel
```

Next, define the steel shapes and joist designations in your model.
```python
w12x16 = SteelBeamSize('W12X16', aisc.W_shapes.W12X16)
w16x26 = SteelBeamSize('W16X26', aisc.W_shapes.W16X26)
k_14k1 = SteelJoistSize('14K1', sji.K_Series.K_14K1)
```

Next, define the primary and secondary framing in the roof bay framing system. 
Note that all inputs should be in kips and inches.
```python
p_length = 20*12 # length of primary members in inches
s_length = 20*12 # length of secondary members in inches

# Support types are designated by tuples representing (Tx, Ty, Rz).
# A 0 indicates the degree of freedom is unrestrained while a 1 indicates a 
# restrained degree of freedom.
p_support = [[0, (1, 1, 0)], [p_length, (1, 1, 0)]]
s_support = [[0, (1, 1, 0)], [s_length, (1, 1, 0)]]

p_girder1 = PrimaryMember(p_length, w16x26, p_support)
p_girder2 = PrimaryMember(p_length, w16x26, p_support)
s_beam1 = SecondaryMember(s_length, w12x16, s_support)
s_beam2 = SecondaryMember(s_length, w12x16, s_support)
s_joist1 = SecondaryMember(s_length, k_14k1, s_support)
s_joist2 = SecondaryMember(s_length, k_14k1, s_support)
s_joist3 = SecondaryMember(s_length, k_14k1, s_support)

p_framing = PrimaryFraming([p_girder1, p_girder2])
s_framing = SecondaryFraming([s_beam1, s_joist1, s_joist2, s_joist3, s_beam2])
```
Note that each member should be individually defined as shown above. Otherwise,
the loadings will not be applied correctly to the members.

The roof slope can optionally be set in the ```SecondaryFraming``` object by
using the keyword ```slope``` and entering the roof slope in inches/foot. The
default value is ```0.25```.

Next, define the loading in the roof bay.
```python
p_framing = PrimaryFraming([p_girder1, p_girder2])
s_framing = SecondaryFraming([s_beam1, s_joist1, s_joist2, s_joist3, s_beam2])

q_dl = 20/1000/144 # Surface dead load in ksi
q_rl = 22.4/1000/144 # Surface rain load at secondary drainage inlet in ksi

loading = Loading(q_dl, q_rl)
```
The input rain load should include the static head and the hydraulic head, but
no ponding head.

Finally, define the ```PondPyModel``` object and analyze the model.
```python
pondpy_model = PondPyModel(p_framing, s_framing, loading)

pondpy_model.perform_analysis()
```
Optional arguments for the ```PondPyModel``` include:

- ```mirrored_left```: bool indicating whether the roof bay is mirrored
    on the left side; default is ```False```

- ```mirrored_right``` : bool indicating whether the roof bay is mirrored
    on the right side; default is ```False```

- ```stop_criterion``` : float indicating the error in total impounded
    water weight at which the iterative analysis should be terminated;
    default is ```0.0001```

- ```max_iter``` : int indicating the maximum number of iterations that
    should be performed; default is ```50```
    
- ```show_results``` : bool indicating whether the iteration results should
    be printed to the terminal upon completion of the analysis;
    default is ```True```

### Analysis Results
Each primary and secondary member is represented within the PondPyModel object
by a BeamModel object. As such a great deal of analysis results can be obtained
fairly easily once the analysis is complete.

- To access the deflected shape, shear force diagram, or bending moment diagram
  of a particular member, use the following calls:
  ```python
  member = pondpy_model.roof_bay_model.secondary_members[0]
  bmd = member.plot_bmd()
  bmd.show()
  ```
  The shear force diagram and deflected shape can be accessed in a similar
  fashion using the ```plot_sfd()``` and ```plot_deflected_shape()``` methods.

  The deflected shape, shear force diagram, and bending moment diagram plots
  for all members can all be generated by using the ```RoofBayModel```'s
  ```generate_plots()``` method.

  ```python
  plots = pondpy_model.roof_bay_model.generate_plots()
  ```

  This method returns a ```dict``` object with keys ```bmd```, ```sfd```, and
  ```defl```, each of which is associated with a sub-dictionary with keys
  ```Primary``` and ```Secondary```. Each sub-dictionary contains a list of
  the associated plot for each primary or secondary member, as applicable.

- The support reactions can be obtained as follows:
  ```python
  support_nodes = member.support_nodes
  support_reactions = [member.support_reactions[node] for node in support_nodes]
  ```

Several other attributes of the BeamModel object can be accessed in a similar
fashion.

### Report Generation
**New:** A report of the PondPyModel analysis results can now be generated by
calling the PondPyModel's ```generate_report()``` method.

Once an analysis has been performed, simply call the method:
```python
output_folder = 'path/to/output/folder/'
pondpy_model.generate_report(output_folder)
```

Once complete, navigate to the folder you designated as the output folder and
view the report.

See the example_reports directory in this repo for an example report created
using the example in main.py.

Note that only the final analysis results can currently be accessed.
