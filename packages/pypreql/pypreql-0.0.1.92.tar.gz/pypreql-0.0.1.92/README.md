## PreQL/Trilogy

pypreql is an experimental implementation of the [PreQL/Trilogy](https://github.com/preqldata) (prequel trilogy) language, a modified SQL syntax that compiles to SQL intended to embrace the best features of SQL while fixing common pain points.

PreQL/Trilogy looks like SQL, but doesn't require table references, group by, or joins directly in queries, shifting some parts of a standard SQL query into a reusable, lightweight semantic binding layer. When you query, it puts the focus on what you want to get, not how you want to get it - you've already done that work once in your data model.

It's perfect for a modern data company that just can't quit SQL, but wants less pain, with a rich extension ecosystem to integrate with other tools like DBT.

PypreQL can be run locally to parse and execute preql [.preql] models.  

The PreQL language spec itself will be linked from the above repo. 

You can read more about the project [here](https://preqldata.dev/) and try out an interactive demo on the page an interactive demo [here](https://preqldata.dev/demo). 

PreQL looks like like SQL:
```sql
SELECT
    name,
    count(name) as name_count
WHERE 
    name='Elvis'
ORDER BY
    name_count desc
LIMIT 10;
```
## Goals
vs SQL, the goals are:

Preserve:
- Correctness
- Accessibility

Enhance:
- Simplicity
- Understandability
- Refactoring/mantainability
- Reusability

Maintain:
- Acceptable performance

## Backends

The current PreQL implementation supports compiling to these SQL flavors:

- Bigquery
- SQL Server
- DuckDB
- Snowflake

## Basic Example - Python

Preql can be run directly in python.

A bigquery example, similar to bigquery [the quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/query-public-dataset-console)

```python


from preql import Dialects, Environment

environment = Environment()

environment.parse('''

key name string;
key gender string;
key state string;
key year int;
key yearly_name_count int; int;


datasource usa_names(
    name:name,
    number:yearly_name_count,
    year:year,
    gender:gender,
    state:state
)
address bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013;

'''
)
executor = Dialects.BIGQUERY.default_executor(environment=environment)

results = executor.execute_text(
'''SELECT
    name,
    sum(yearly_name_count) -> name_count 
WHERE
    name = 'Elvis'
ORDER BY
    name_count desc
LIMIT 10;
'''

)
# multiple queries can result from one text batch
for row in results:
    # get results for first query
    answers = row.fetchall()
    for x in answers:
        print(x)
```


## Basic Example - CLI

Preql can be run through a CLI tool, 'trilogy'.

After installing preql, you can run the trilogy CLI with two required positional arguments; the first the path to a file or a direct command,
and second the dialect to run.

`trilogy run <cmd or path to preql file> <dialect>`

> [!TIP]
> This will only work for basic backends, such as Bigquery with local default credentials; if the backend requires more configuration, the CLI will require additional config arguments.

The CLI can also be used for formatting. PreQL has a default formatting style that should always be adhered to.

`trilogy fmt <path to preql file>`


## More Examples

Examples can be found in the [public model repository](https://github.com/preqldata/trilogy-public-models).
This is a good place to start for more complex examples.
