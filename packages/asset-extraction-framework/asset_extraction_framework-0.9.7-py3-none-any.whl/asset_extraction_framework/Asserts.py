## Performs an equality assertion with a descriptive failture message that includes the type of data being compared
## and the actual/expected values, like the following examples:
##  "Expected <displayed_datatype> <expected_value>, received <received_value>"
##  "Expected signature RIFF, received \x00x\12\x13\xff"
## \param[in] received_value - The value actually observed.
##            In the example above, this is "\x00x\12\x13\xff"
## \param[in] expected_value - The value to which the received value should be compared.
## \param[in] displayed_datatype - The datatype of the received and expected values.
## \param[in] warn_only - When True, do not raise an exception for a failed assertion; rather, print a warning and return False.
