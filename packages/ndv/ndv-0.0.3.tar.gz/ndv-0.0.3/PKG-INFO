Simple, fast-loading, asynchronous, n-dimensional array viewer for Qt, with minimal dependencies.

```python
import ndv

data = ndv.data.cells3d()
# or ndv.data.nd_sine_wave()
# or *any* arraylike object (see support below)

ndv.imshow(data)
```

![Montage](https://github.com/pyapp-kit/ndv/assets/1609449/712861f7-ddcb-4ecd-9a4c-ba5f0cc1ee2c)

As an alternative to `ndv.imshow()`, you can instantiate the `ndv.NDViewer` (`QWidget` subclass) directly

```python
from qtpy.QtWidgets import QApplication
from ndv import NDViewer

app = QApplication([])
viewer = NDViewer(data)
viewer.show()
app.exec()
```

## `ndv.NDViewer`

- very fast import and load time
- supports arbitrary number of dimensions, with 2D/3D view canvas, and sliders for all non-visible dims
- sliders support integer as well as slice (range)-based slicing
- colormaps provided by [cmap](https://github.com/tlambert03/cmap)
- supports [vispy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) and [pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx) backends
- supports any numpy-like duck arrays, including (but not limited to):
  - `numpy.ndarray`
  - `cupy.ndarray`
  - `dask.array.Array`
  - `jax.Array`
  - `pyopencl.array.Array`
  - `sparse.COO`
  - `tensorstore.TensorStore` (supports named dimensions)
  - `torch.Tensor` (supports named dimensions)
  - `xarray.DataArray` (supports named dimensions)
  - `zarr` (supports named dimensions)

See examples for each of these array types in [examples](./examples/)

> [!NOTE]
> *You can add support for any custom storage class by subclassing `ndv.DataWrapper`
> and implementing a couple methods.  
> (This doesn't require modifying ndv, but contributions of new wrappers are welcome!)*

## Installation

The only required dependencies are `numpy` and `superqt[cmap,iconify]`.
You will also need a Qt backend (PyQt or PySide) and one of either
[vispy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy) or [pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx),
which can be installed through extras `ndv[<pyqt|pyside>,<vispy|pygfx>]`:

```python
pip install ndv[pyqt,vispy]
```

> [!TIP]
> If you have both vispy and pygfx installed, `ndv` will default to using vispy,
> but you can override this with the environment variable
> `NDV_CANVAS_BACKEND=pygfx` or `NDV_CANVAS_BACKEND=vispy`

## Motivation

This package arose from the need for a way to *quickly* view multi-dimensional arrays with
zero tolerance for long import times and/or excessive dependency lists. I want something that I can
use to view any of the many multi-dimensional array types, out of the box, with no assumptions
about dimensionality. I want it to work reasonably well with remote, asynchronously loaded data.
I also want it to take advantage of things like named dimensions and categorical coordinate values
when available. For now, it's a Qt-only widget, since that's where the need arose, but I can
imagine a jupyter widget in the future (likely as a remote frame buffer for vispy/pygfx).

I do not intend for this to grow into full-fledged application, or wrap a complete scene graph,
though point and ROI selection would be welcome additions.
