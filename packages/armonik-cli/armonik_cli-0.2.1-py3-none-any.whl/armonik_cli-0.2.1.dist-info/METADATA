# ArmoniK.Admin.CLI

This project is part of the [ArmoniK](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK) project.
In particular it is a consitutent of its [Core](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Core)
component which, among its main functionalities, implements several gRPC services aiming to
provide a user with a robust task scheduler for a high throughput computing application.

The .proto files in the directory [./Protos/V1](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Api/tree/main/Protos/V1) 
provide the core data model and functionalities for ArmoniK and are used to generate the different SDKs.
