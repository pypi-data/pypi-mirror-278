## Commercial usage

Sparrow is available under the GPL 3.0 license, promoting freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software while ensuring any modifications remain open source under the same license. This aligns with our commitment to supporting the open-source community and fostering collaboration.

Additionally, we recognize the diverse needs of organizations, including small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, Sparrow is also offered for free commercial use to organizations with gross revenue below $5 million USD in the past 12 months, enabling them to leverage Sparrow without the financial burden often associated with high-quality software solutions.

For businesses that exceed this revenue threshold or require usage terms not accommodated by the GPL 3.0 license—such as integrating Sparrow into proprietary software without the obligation to disclose source code modifications—we offer dual licensing options. Dual licensing allows Sparrow to be used under a separate proprietary license, offering greater flexibility for commercial applications and proprietary integrations. This model supports both the project's sustainability and the business's needs for confidentiality and customization.

If your organization is seeking to utilize Sparrow under a proprietary license, or if you are interested in custom workflows, consulting services, or dedicated support and maintenance options, please contact us at abaranovskis@redsamuraiconsulting.com. We're here to provide tailored solutions that meet your unique requirements, ensuring you can maximize the benefits of Sparrow for your projects and workflows.
