## For developers

Clone the GitHub repository and then follow the next steps:

### Creating a virtual environment
Run the following code to create a virtual environment called `.venv`
```
python -m venv .venv
```

#### Activate
- On Unix systems:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Deactivate
```
deactivate
```

### Installing packages
After the virtual environment has been activated, install required packages by using:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will allow you to build the documentation using Sphinx.

### Editing version number
When a new version is created, the new numbering should be updated in the following files:
- docs/source/conf.py
- pyAbacus/\_\_init__.py 
- setup.cfg

### Building docs
Go to the `docs` folder and run
```
make <command>
```
Where `<command>` is one of the following:
- `latexpdf`
- `html`

To run the `latexpdf` command you will need a working installation of Latex.
