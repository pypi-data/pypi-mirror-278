# GraphMemory - GraphRAG Database

## Overview
This project provides an embedded graph database implementation with vector similarity search (VSS) using DuckDB. It includes a Python class `GraphMemory` for managing nodes and edges. 

Each node has a unique ID, a JSON data field (any arbitrary dictionary), and a vector of floating point values. 

Each edge has a unique ID, a source node ID, a target node ID, a relationship type, and a weight.

This database can be used for any graph-based RAG application or knowledge graph application.

Vector embeddings can be created using [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) or other API based models.

## Installation
```sh
pip install graphmemory
```

## Usage

### GraphMemory Class
The `GraphMemory` class provides methods to manage nodes and edges, perform bulk inserts, create indexes, and find nearest neighbors using vector similarity search.

### Auto-Incrementing IDs
If you do not provide an ID for a node or edge, the database will automatically assign a unique ID.

### Example
```python
from graphmemory import GraphMemory
from graphmemory.models import Node, Edge

import json
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

# Use a LLM to extract structured data from a unstructured text (there are a variety of ways to do this)
text = "George Washington was the first President of the United States and served from 1789 to 1797."

def extract_dict(text):
    return json.loads(client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Extract structured data from this text: " + text}
        ]
        ).choices[0].message.content)


gw_dict = extract_dict(text)
print(gw_dict)

# Output:
# {
#   "President": "George Washington",
#   "Position": "First President",
#   "Country": "United States",
#   "Term": "1789-1797"
# }

def calculate_embedding(input_json):
    return client.embeddings.create(
        input=input_json,
        model="text-embedding-3-small"
    ).data[0].embedding


embedding = calculate_embedding(gw_dict)
print(embedding)

# Output:
# [-0.006929283495992422, -0.005336422007530928, ... (omitted for spacing),  0.04664124920964241, -0.024047505110502243]


# Initialize the database from disk (make sure to set vector_length correctly)
graph_db = GraphMemory(database='graph.db', vector_length=len(embedding))

# Insert nodes
node1 = Node(data=gw_dict, vector=embedding)
node1_id = graph_db.insert_node(node1)

text2 = "Thomas Jefferson was the first Secretary of State of the United States and served from 1797 to 1801."
tj_dict = extract_dict(text2)

node2 = Node(data=tj_dict, vector=calculate_embedding(tj_dict))
node2_id = graph_db.insert_node(node2)

# Insert edge
edge = Edge(source_id=node1_id, target_id=node2_id, relation="served_under", weight=0.5)
graph_db.insert_edge(edge)

# Print all nodes in the database
nodes = graph_db.nodes_to_json()
print("Nodes:", nodes)

# Print all edges in the database
edges = graph_db.edges_to_json()
print("Edges:", edges)

# Find connected nodes
connected_nodes = graph_db.connected_nodes(node1_id)
print("Connected Nodes:", connected_nodes)

# Find nearest neighbors
neighbors = graph_db.nearest_nodes(calculate_embedding({"President": "George Washington"}), limit=1)
print("Nearest Neighbors:", neighbors)
```

## GraphMemory Class Methods

The `GraphMemory` class provides the following public methods for interacting with the graph database:

1. `__init__(self, database=None, vector_length=3)`
   - Initializes the database connection and sets up the database schema if necessary.

2. `set_vector_length(self, vector_length)`
   - Sets the length of the vectors for the nodes in the database.

3. `create_tables(self)`
   - Creates the necessary database tables for nodes and edges if they do not exist.

4. `insert_node(self, node: Node) -> int`
   - Inserts a node into the database and returns the node ID.

5. `insert_edge(self, edge: Edge)`
   - Inserts an edge between two nodes in the database.

6. `bulk_insert_nodes(self, nodes: List[Node]) -> List[Node]`
   - Performs a bulk insert of multiple nodes into the database.

7. `bulk_insert_edges(self, edges: List[Edge])`
   - Performs a bulk insert of multiple edges into the database.

8. `delete_node(self, node_id: int)`
   - Deletes a node and its associated edges from the database.

9. `delete_edge(self, source_id: int, target_id: int)`
   - Deletes an edge from the database.

10. `create_index(self)`
    - Creates an index on the node vectors to improve search performance.

11. `nearest_nodes(self, vector: List[float], limit: int) -> List[Neighbor]`
    - Finds and returns the nearest neighbor nodes based on vector similarity.

12. `connected_nodes(self, node_id: int) -> List[Node]`
    - Retrieves all nodes directly connected to the specified node.

13. `nodes_to_json(self)`
    - Returns a JSON representation of all nodes in the database.

14. `edges_to_json(self)`
    - Returns a JSON representation of all edges in the database.

15. `get_node(self, node_id: int)`
    - Retrieves a specific node by its ID.

16. `print_json(self)`
    - Prints the JSON representation of all nodes and edges in the database.

These methods facilitate the management and querying of the graph database, allowing for efficient data handling and retrieval.
